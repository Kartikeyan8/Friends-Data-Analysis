Ross: (mortified) Hi.
Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
Ross: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Ross: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Ross: Sorry.
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Ross: Hi. 
Ross: (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.
Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Ross: He finally asked you out?
Ross: (choked voice) That'd be good...
Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Ross: A wandering?
Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Ross: Okay, sure.
Ross: (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Ross: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Ross: You guys.
Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Ross: That only took me an hour.
Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? 
Ross: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)
Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. 
Ross: You got a job? 
Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... 
Ross: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
Ross: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... 
Ross: No. No, I gotta go home sometime. 
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- 
Ross: No no no, go- 
Ross: Split it? 
Ross: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. 
Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. 
Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? 
Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will... 
Ross: Goodnight. 
Ross: I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.) 
Ross: There's an image. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Ross: Does she. 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Ross: Mm. 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Ross: Got me. 
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? 
Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 
Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! 
Ross: Can I use.. either thumb? 
Ross: Easy. 
Ross: What is this?! 
Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. 
Ross: Hey, Pheebs. 
Ross: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. 
Ross: ...What shoe? 
Ross: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 
Ross: You know what I like most about him, though? 
Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself. 
Ross: Well.. 
Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... 
Ross: What? 
Ross: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
Ross: A thumb?! 
Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. 
Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
Ross: If only he were a woman. 
Ross: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.) 
Ross: (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go. 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? 
Ross: Hey, I might! 
Ross: Is there somebody else? 
Ross: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were. 
Ross: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. 
Ross: Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
Ross: So how'd it go? 
Ross: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.) 
Ross: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? 
Ross: Joey, uh- OMnipotent. 
Ross: I cannot sleep in a public place. 
Ross: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. 
Ross: Why? 
Ross: Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. 
Ross: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? 
Ross: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth? 
Ross: Ohhh. 
Ross: Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover. 
Ross: What are you doing? 
Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? 
Ross: You can totally, totally live on this. 
Ross: Oh, by the way, great service tonight. 
Ross: Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry. 
Ross: Peach pit. 
Ross: (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had- 
Ross: Actually, nectarines, but basically... 
Ross: Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Ross: (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh. 
Ross: No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost... 
Ross: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal! 
Ross: Pass it! Pass it! 
Ross: (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. 
Ross: Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) Heyy... 
Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated... 
Ross: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... 
Ross: My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part) 
Ross: It was my first time. 
Ross: Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.) 
Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? 
Ross: The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. 
Ross: (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck. 
Ross: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! 
Ross: (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) 
Ross: ...Now that was fun. 
Ross: (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red. 
Ross: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively) 
Ross: Green. To the green. 
Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Ross: Multiple orgasms!
Ross: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Ross: Tony?
Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Ross: That guy, he burns me up.
Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Ross: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Ross: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Ross: (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Ross: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Ross: Nuh-uh.
Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Ross: (sheepish) No.
Ross: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Ross: What's goin' on?
Ross: Was your basket on top?
Ross: So?
Ross: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's machine.
Ross: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. 
Ross: (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.
Ross: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Ross: Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Ross: Rach, have you never done this before?
Ross: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ross: (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Ross: That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
Ross: (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Ross: All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Ross: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Ross: You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Ross: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
Ross: No.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Ross: Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Ross: Is it? Feels like two.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh. Hel-lo!
Ross: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Ross: C'mon! C'mon!
Ross: No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Ross: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Ross: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Ross: Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Ross: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Ross: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Ross: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Ross: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Ross: Monica? You're Mom.
Ross: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Ross: You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Ross: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Ross: No? What happened, big guy?
Ross: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Ross: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Ross: She is a kook.
Ross: And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Ross: That's my sister.
Ross: Pheebs, what about you?
Ross: Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Ross: The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Ross: Step back.
Ross: Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Ross: Come on.
Ross: (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
Ross: Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated. 
Ross: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Ross: But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Ross: Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Ross: Mmmm.
Ross: I do.
Ross: (innocently) What?
Ross: (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
Ross: No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross: I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Ross: I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?
Ross: Shhhh!
Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
Ross: See?
Ross: (to Joey) OK, here goes.
Ross: I'm going to do it.
Ross: You come out there, you're a dead man.
Ross: Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
Ross: OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Ross: OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ross: Yes, yes, that's right...
Ross: What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Ross: (nonchalantly) Yeah?
Ross: (rolling) Lucky sixes....
Ross: (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Ross: No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Ross: That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Ross: (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Ross: Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Ross: That's... that's classic.
Ross: Paolo. Hi.
Ross: Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Ross: Thing, yes. Thing.
Ross: No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um... 
Ross: No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Ross: Yeah! Se vice?
Ross: So you do know a little English.
Ross: Do you know the word crapweasel?
Ross: That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Ross: OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Ross: Oh.. oh... oh.
Ross: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Ross: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Ross: (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Ross: So, uh, how's she doing?
Ross: Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Ross: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Ross: She looks so small. 
Ross: Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. 
Ross: Bye, Nana. 
Ross: Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Ross: She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Ross: I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)
Ross: Now she's passed.
Ross: Twice.
Ross: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Ross: Nono, she's gone.
Ross: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Ross: (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
Ross: Here's my retainer!
Ross: (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
Ross: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
Ross: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
Ross: Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)
Ross: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Ross: (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Ross: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Ross: Oh my God..
Ross: Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
Ross: (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
Ross: Some days it's all I can think about. 
Ross: What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Ross: Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Ross: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)
Ross: I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Ross: What, what is it?
Ross: Oh! No-n-
Ross: I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Ross: Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
Ross: ...Chandler! 
Ross: (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Ross: Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
Ross: No.
Ross: Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
Ross: That little naked guy would be me.
Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Ross: Got me.
Ross: Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
Ross: (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Ross: No, they're not.
Ross: You're wrong.
Ross: You're wrong.
Ross: (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.
Ross: (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. 
Ross: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Ross: Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ross: (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Ross: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Ross: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Ross: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Ross: Kinda like a big face without skin.
Ross: Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Ross: (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Ross: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Ross: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Ross: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Ross: Really?
Ross: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Ross: Oh, I hate this story.
Ross: I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Ross: That's closer.
Ross: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. 
Ross: Ok, Mom never hit.
Ross: Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Ross: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Ross: (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Ross: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Ross: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Ross: Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Ross: Does it always, uh--?
Ross: (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Ross: (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Ross: Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.
Ross: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Ross: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
Ross: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Ross: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Ross: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Ross: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Ross: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Ross: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)
Ross: Just a smidge.
Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Ross: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Ross: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Ross: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Ross: Four.
Ross: Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
Ross: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Ross: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Ross: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... 
Ross: Really.
Ross: What, uh... what juggling thing?
Ross: No.
Ross: Par-tay! 
Ross: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Ross: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Ross: Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Ross: (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Ross: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Ross: (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Ross: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Ross: Oh, please...
Ross: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Ross: Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Ross: (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Ross: Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Ross: ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
Ross: Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Ross: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)
Ross: Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Ross: No. It's the one he's licking.
Ross: You're good.
Ross: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Ross: When?
Ross: The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Ross: Please.
Ross: Right.
Ross: Uh-oh...
Ross: Hey, is Chandler here?
Ross: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Ross: Okay. 
Ross: What code?
Ross: Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Ross: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Ross: Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross: I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Ross: Well... not in the same way...
Ross: Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Well, not playing raquetball!
Ross: He didn't get the goggles!
Ross: Do they wait for me to do this?
Ross: Why would I tell him?
Ross: Oh...
Ross: You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Ross: Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Ross: I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Ross: Thanks, man, big help.
Ross: I wasn't- I mean, I-
Ross: I know-
Ross: Chandler-
Ross: Chandler-
Ross: Joey-
Ross: I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Ross: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Ross: Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Ross: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Ross: (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Ross: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Ross: Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee) That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
Ross: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Ross: You're kidding.
Ross: Wow!
Ross: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
Ross: So, what's going on now?
Ross: Whaddya see?
Ross: (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
Ross: You mean that?
Ross: Yeah? How'd it go?
Ross: Well, howdya feel?
Ross: Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Ross: Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
Ross: (waves) Hello!
Joey, Chandler, and Ross: (sitting in living room, imitating Paolo) Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
Ross: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
Ross: Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna. 
Ross: (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
Ross: (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....? 
Ross: Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a picture frame)
Ross: Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Ross: (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)
Ross: (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...
Ross: Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Ross: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) Or isn't...
Ross: Susan...
Ross: Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Ross: (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Ross: Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? 
Ross: (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. 
Ross: No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach, then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)
Ross: (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and Susan laugh)
Ross: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Ross: Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Ross: Hi Pheebs!
Ross: I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Ross: My God.
Ross: The actress!
Ross: Thanks Rach.
Ross: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)
Ross:(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...
Ross: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Ross: (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Ross: Come on, two on one.
Ross: What, now?
Ross: (entering) How's it going?
Ross: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
Ross: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Ross: (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: You all right?
Ross: Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Ross: What?
Ross: Huh.
Ross: Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
Ross: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Ross: Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Ross: (astonished) What? 
Ross: I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
Ross: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Ross: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Ross: I'm having a son. Um...
Ross: You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Ross: Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Ross: Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Ross: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Ross: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Ross: Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Ross: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Ross: I dunno, there's just something about...
Ross: We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Ross: So Joey, you okay?
Ross: She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Ross: She lent me an egg once.
Ross: Aw, right.
Ross: Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
Ross: An egg?
Ross: I think it's insane.
Ross: Hi. She said yes.
Ross: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Ross: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
Ross: If you wanna put a label on it.
Ross: Nope, nope, that's it. 
Ross: Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!
Ross: So, um, what do you do for a living?
Ross: Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. 
Ross: Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Ross: Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Ross: You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?
Ross: Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years. 
Ross: Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)
Ross: No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Ross: No but, no but.
Ross: That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Ross: Grazie.
Ross: What's going on?
Ross: Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Ross: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Ross: OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Ross: Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Ross: Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Ross: Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh.
Ross: Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Ross: Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
Ross: OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Ross: (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?
Ross: Ah....
Ross: (panicked) Er.... um..... 
Ross: Um... uh.... vulva.
Ross: Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Ross: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Ross: (deadpan) Please be kidding.
Ross: OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
Ross: That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)
Ross: Joey, please.
Ross: (impressed) Wow.
Ross: I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Sure.
Ross: OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Ross: Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Ross: I, er...
Ross: I want to take my tongue... and... 
Ross: ....and....
Ross: ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Ross: (rushing to explain) Funny story!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Ross: Oh, I was unbelievable.
Ross: I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Ross: Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Ross: Yeah, which was nice.
Ross: Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Ross: Rach, did you proofread these?
Ross: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
Chandler and Ross: Hey.
Ross: I don't know.
Ross: No, it's not just that. It's just—I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)
Ross: What?
Ross: Who?
Ross: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!
Ross: We're fine, we're fine.
Ross: Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Ross: Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Ross: No, women are welcome to play.
Ross: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Ross: No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't—you can't do...
Ross:
Ross: Oh, you're... (gives up)
Ross: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Ross: The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Ross: Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Ross: (pause)...Yeah.
Ross: Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
Ross: I'm not a nice guy.
Ross: Alright boys, let's eat.
Ross: You still on that?
Ross: You are way off, pal.
Ross: Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not any more. I just—I...
Ross: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Ross: You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Ross: Alright.
Ross: I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Ross: Alright.
Ross: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Ross: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Ross: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Ross: Uh... to the bathroom.
Ross: I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
Ross: Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green.
Ross: Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down cards)
Ross: Oh, I am very in.
Ross: No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?
Ross: Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)
Ross: Show them to me!
Ross: Let me see! Show them!
Ross: First of all, I'm not losing...
Ross: Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Ross: (mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Ross: I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
Ross: I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Ross: No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
Ross: I'm in. (throws in chips)
Ross: One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
Ross: I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
Ross: I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)
Ross: (to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy.
Ross: Fifteen.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Ross: You got me.
Ross: Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)
Ross: Uh.... bean! Bean!
Ross: Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Really.
Ross: Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Ross: Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Ross: Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Ross: ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Ross: Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Ross: That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Ross: 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Ross: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Ross: Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Ross: Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Ross: Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Ross: Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Ross: Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Ross: Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine) Well-
Ross: Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine) 
Ross: Oh, what? What-what?
Ross: ...Yeah?
Ross: (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Ross: No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Ross: You called Animal Control?
Ross: Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Ross: That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Ross: Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Ross: Cat!
Ross: My uncle Marcel.
Ross: Marcel?
Ross: Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Ross: Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Ross: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Ross: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Ross: I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Ross: Oh, forget it, okay?
Ross: What? What?
Ross: Hi, did you order some bananas?
Ross: Gimme back my monkey.
Ross: Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Ross: Marcel! What've you done to him?
Ross: Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)
Ross: C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)
Ross: Okay, gimme my monkey back.
Ross: Alright, I want my monkey.
Ross: (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Ross: It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Ross: Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Ross: Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Ross: Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Ross: We have got to start locking that door!
Ross: I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Ross: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Joey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?
Ross: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Ross: What? What? What?!
Ross: That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Ross: That's, that's nice twice!
Ross: What was with the dishes?
Ross: ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ross: You-you had what?
Ross: What, uh... what were you thinking?
Ross: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Ross: It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Ross: (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Ross: Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: "Heating device."
Ross: Five letters.
Ross: I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Ross: Second date!
Ross: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Ross: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-
Ross: What? It's, it's just a phase.
Ross: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Ross: What?
Ross: (Mortified) Hi.
Ross: At the vet.
Ross: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Ross: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Ross: I'm gonna have to give him up.
Ross: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Ross: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Ross: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Ross: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Ross: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Ross: (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Ross: Where exactly is your zoo?
Ross: Yes.
Ross: No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Ross: Well I, I don't know. Why?
Ross: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Ross: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Ross: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Ross: Just, just say what you feel.
Ross: That was good.
Ross: Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Ross: Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Ross: Why, why, why would you dream that?
Ross: I love it, when we share.
Ross: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Ross: Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Ross: Oh, it's my new beeper.
Ross: No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Ross: College?
Ross: Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Ross: (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, André is not here. (to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Ross: (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.
Ross: Oh, oh Chandler...
Ross: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Phoebe, Joey, and Ross: 'My scones.'
Ross: (on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.
Ross: Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Ross: You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Ross: Huh!
Ross: Are you not seeing him anymore?
Ross: Oh, yeah.
Joey, Chander, and Ross: Sorry.
Ross: It's morphin time!
Ross: Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Ross: Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Ross: I thought that was just a rumour.
Ross: Are you're hands still wet?
Ross: I'm here.
Ross: What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby.
Ross: Ooh, Ooh.
Ross: I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Ross: I'm hurt.
Ross: Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Ross: Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
Ross: What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Ross: Joey, get out of the fridge.
Ross: What is that? (refering to the sandwich)
Ross: Save it.
Ross: Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
Ross: That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Ross: She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Ross: I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Ross: God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Ross: She's not even here yet.
Ross: (to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
Ross: Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
Ross: Stopped for a Chunky.
Ross: (weakly) No.
Ross: Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Ross: 59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha.
Ross: I'll get it.
Ross: I got it—I'm getting it!
Ross: Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Ross: Breathe.
Ross: Breathe.
Ross: Breathe.
Ross: 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Ross: Who the hell is Jordie?
Ross: No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Ross: What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Ross: I got it.
Ross: I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Ross: Why?
Ross: No, you started it.
Ross: But...
Ross: (to Susan) Thanks a lot.
Ross: (to Carol) Yeah, listen...
Ross: Please. This is so your fault.
Ross: Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Ross: You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Ross: Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Ross: Yeah, Susan.
Ross: I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow.
Ross: Help! Help!
Susan and Ross: (even louder) Help!
Ross: Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Ross: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Ross: Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Ross: You wanna explain that?
Ross: Ok, got the vent open.
Ross: Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Ross: Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Ross: We're here!
Ross: Long story, honey.
Ross: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Ross: (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.
Ross: We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Ross: Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Ross: Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
Ross: (thinking) How 'bout Ben?
Ross: We uh, we just cooked it up.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Ross: The head, the head. You gotta...
Ross: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) 
Ross: No, this is pretty much it.
Ross: All right, I'll see you guys later.
Ross: And here's little Ben nodding off...
Ross: (quietly) That would be nice.
Ross: (overhearing) What kind of research?
Ross: Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over)
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
Ross: I'm going to China. 
Ross: Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)
Ross: (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Ross: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Ross: Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?
Ross: No.
Ross: At the coffeehouse, right.
Ross: OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: (sigh)....I have to go to China.
Ross: No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Ross: Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Ross: Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)
Ross: I know.
Ross: (something in Chinese)
Ross: Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
Ross: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Ross: Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Ross: Can't do it, can you?
Ross: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Ross: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. 
Ross: I know.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Ross: (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Ross: Well, start looking. 
Ross: Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Ross: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Ross: Come on, they're gonna love you.
Ross: (seeing her) Rach!
Ross: It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Ross: You're bleeding. 
Ross: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Ross: That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?
Ross: Everyone, this is Julie.
Ross: And bus.
Ross:  The screaming guy?
Ross: You gotta hear this story.
Ross: 200 at least.
Ross: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. 
Ross: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
Ross: Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Ross: Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Ross: It was you, pal.
Ross: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Ross: I didn't order lemonade.
Ross: But...
Ross: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Ross: (on phone) Hello? Hi.
Ross: (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up either. 
Ross: Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Ross: Rachel! I'll just call her back. 
Ross: (calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)
Ross: Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching.
Ross: Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Ross: (to Rachel) So, uh, he's back.
Ross: No, not a problem.
Ross: How's the hair?
Ross:  Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that meant.)
Ross: (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the shoulder which causes him to jump.)
Ross: What?
Ross: What?
Ross: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Ross: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)
Ross: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Ross: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Ross: Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
Ross: What's goin' on?
Ross: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Ross: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. 
Ross: You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?
Ross: Okay.  Okay. (They hug.) Okay.
Ross: (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?
Ross: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Ross: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Ross: Carol?
Ross: (enters) Hi, honey.
Ross: Hello to the rest.
Ross: (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Ross: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Ross: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Ross: My mommies love me. That's clever.
Ross: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Ross: It's breast milk.
Ross: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Ross: No!
Ross: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Ross: I did not freak out. 
Ross: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Ross: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Ross: (jumping away) That would be no.
Ross: (staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Ross: Oh, you've tasted it.
Ross: (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it off.) 
Ross: (with a mouthful) That's not bad. 
Ross: I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Ross: Hey Mon!
Ross: Nope.
Ross: Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Ross: Getting it away from me would be job one.
Ross: You need to get some sleep.
Ross: Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Ross: Hmm?
Ross: Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Ross: I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: What?
Ross: No.
Ross: Nope.
Ross: What?
Ross: Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Ross: Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. 
Ross: Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Ross: (entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
Ross: Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Guess what?
Ross: They published my paper.
Ross: How could you have told her? 
Ross: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Ross: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Ross: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Ross: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Ross: Noo!
Ross: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Ross: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times? 
Ross: I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Ross: Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Ross: No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Ross: Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Ross: Nooo!
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Ross: So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Ross: Yes! 
Ross: Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Hmph.
Ross: With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Ross: Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
Ross: I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
Ross: No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom standing where Rachel is)
Ross: I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)

Ross: Wait a minute, look.
Ross: Look, look, look.
Ross: It's an empty apartment.
Ross: We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Ross: There it is.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Ross: And it works both ways.
Ross: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Ross: (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Ross: Bye sweetie.
Ross: (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Ross: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...
Ross: I'm gonna use the cushion.
Ross: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Ross: Yep.
Ross: Shoot.
Ross: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Ross: What are you talking about?
Ross: What?
Ross: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
Ross: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Ross: I'm gonna tell Mom.
Ross: Crazy.
Ross: (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Ross: How's the maniac?
Ross: You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Ross: (entering) Hello. 
Ross: (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Ross: Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)
Ross: (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?
Ross: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Ross: Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Ross: You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Ross: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)
Ross: And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Ross: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Ross: (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.
Ross: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
Ross: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Joey and Ross: Go Joe!!!
Ross: (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's door, dead.)
Ross: Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Ross: Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
Ross: What?
Ross: What are you talking about?
Ross: Okay, you are totally making this up.
Ross: (remembering) Oh God.
Ross: There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)
Ross: (coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. 
Young Ross: (singing) 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' (spills some tea and it drips onto his/her dress) Ohhh! (runs away crying)
Ross: Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Ross: Spiderman?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Okay, I’ve got three of my five.
Ross: Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.
Ross: Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Ross: Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Ross: Susan Sarandon.
Ross: And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ross: (entering) Hey! 
Ross: Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little card)
Ross: Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Ross: That would be me.
Ross: Hey, it’s my list.
Ross: Okay!! Okay!!
Ross: Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Ross: (to Gunther) Thank you.
Ross: Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)
Ross: Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.
Ross: Yeah, maybe.
Ross: What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
Ross: Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Ross: Okay, hold my crawler.
Ross: (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one? 
Ross: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.
Ross: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Ross: Um, yeah.
Ross: Um, no.
Ross: But, okay.
Ross: Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.
Ross: Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Ross: What?
Ross: (to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.
Ross: I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Ross: Yeah, I’ll take some.
Ross: What?
Ross: Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
Ross: Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Ross: (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Ross: I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Ross: Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Ross: Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference
Ross: No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Ross: I don’t know, something girlie.
Ross: (all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
Ross: My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Ross: ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
Ross: (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!
Ross: Well, now I do!!
Ross: Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....
Ross: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
Ross: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Ross: Wait, wait, wait.
Ross: My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Ross: No, I can’t get it out.
Ross: No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
Ross: Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
Ross: Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
Ross: Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
Ross: My wife’s a lesbian.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Ross: Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Ross: We?
Ross: Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ross: Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.
Ross: Fine.
Ross: Hi Gunther.
Ross: What?
Ross: Come on! That’s great.
Ross: Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Ross: Nice to see you again Dr. Green. 
Ross: Ugh, museum.
Ross: There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
Ross: Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.
Ross: It’s not a library...
Ross: So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.
Ross: It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Ross: Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)
Ross: Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
Ross: Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Ross: That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.
Ross: So?
Ross: You really serve people sneezers?
Ross: Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Ross: Oh, ah, you don’t need that.
Ross: The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Ross: Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.
Ross: I know.
Ross: Nothing I do means anything, really.
Ross: Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.
Ross: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.
Ross: Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Ross: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.
Ross: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’
Ross: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.
Ross: Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels.
Ross: Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on it.)
Ross: Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Ross: (to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore.
Ross: Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)
Ross: Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....
Ross: Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.
Ross: Uh.
Ross: And his first name.
Ross: Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Ross: Argue with that.
Ross: I know that!
Ross: What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.
Ross: Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
Ross: Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Ross: Excellent!
Ross: Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
Ross: So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.
Ross: Why? Why can’t you go to him?
Ross: Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.
Ross: Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Ross: (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s not.
Ross: What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Ross: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Ross: Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.
Ross: Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.
Ross: You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hmm?
Ross: Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Ross: (entering) Hey! Everyone.
Ross: How’s my little boy?
Ross: (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him whaling?
Ross: Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.
Ross: And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.
Ross: Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Ross: It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
Ross: I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.
Ross: Monica did it?
Ross: Monica?
Ross: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Ross: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.
Ross: Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle) 
Ross: Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
Ross: Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
Ross: He does not look happy.
Ross: Halftime.
Ross: What?
Ross: Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.
Monica and Ross: Yeah.
Ross: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
Ross: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.
Ross: Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Ross: Can I see you for a second?
Ross: All right, we’re gonna play.
Ross: Here you go. (throws her the ball)
Monica and Ross: (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!
Ross: Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.
Ross: Sweetie, now I pick you.
Ross: Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off.
Ross: Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Ross: Come on, let’s go!
Ross: Yeah, losers talk!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Ross: You, you go long.
Ross: Until we start to look very small.
Ross: Break!!
Ross: One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Ross: Uh, hello, it’s third down.
Ross: Wow!
Ross: It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Ross: Okay, it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you need.
Ross: Well, I said it loud.
Ross: Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Ross: Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Okay. Hut! Hike!
Ross: Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.
Ross: Before the snap!
Ross: Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.
Ross: Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Ross: Oh-ho, okay.
Ross: Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Ross: Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Ross: Oh really! Why is that?
Ross: The Geller Cup.
Ross: Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Ross: That cup is mine!
Ross: Chandler! Chandler!
Ross: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?
Ross: Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Ross: Hey, where’d you get that?
Ross: It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Ross: What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.
Ross: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.
Ross: Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.
Ross: Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.
Ross: Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Ross: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Ross: Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Ross: Hey! It’s 42-21!
Ross: Let go! Let go!
Ross: No! You let go!
Ross: How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
Ross: Hey! It’s starting to snow.
Ross: Gimme the this!
Ross: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Ross: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Ross: All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)
Ross: I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Ross: Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she’ll like?
Ross: All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)
Ross: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore. 
Ross: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Ross: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Ross: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?
Ross: (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?
Ross: Well, that makes sense.
Ross: Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Ross: Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.
Ross: No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)
Ross: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.
Ross: No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Ross: Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)
Ross: All right!!
Ross: ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Ross: Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ross: No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Ross: Mon?
Ross: Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.
Ross: Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.
Ross: I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.
Ross: Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)
Ross: ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?
Ross: Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.
Ross: Monica, I’m cutting you off.
Ross: Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Ross: Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Ross: Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
Ross: Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Ross: Well you sure used a large font.
Ross: Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.
Ross: What, that wasn’t the great news?
Ross: (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Ross: Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
Ross: What’s a scrud?
Ross: I don’t have too. I can just look at you.
Ross: (to himself) Not nice enough.
Ross: (to himself) Good for a scrud.
Ross: That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the salute)
Ross: Hi there!
Ross: Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Ross: Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Ross: Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed to come out.
Ross: That word was swans.
Ross: No. 
Ross: I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)
Ross: Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by for mission countdown!
Ross: Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s head.)
Ross: Real magic does exist.
Ross: Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.
Ross: Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.
Ross: Oh, somebody’s feeling better.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Wow!
Ross: What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Ross: And he’s, he’s a total stranger?
Ross: Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Ross: Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Ross: Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Ross: Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Ross: Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Ross: That’s excellent.
Ross: (to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!
Ross: Which one is Gina?
Ross: That’s okay.
Ross: Hey, Joey.
Ross: Ah, which, which one?
Ross: Mary-Angela.
Ross: Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Ross: All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Ross: Where in Cuba?
Ross: Bummer.
Ross: No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Ross: But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.
Ross: (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Ross: That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)
Ross: That is so made up!
Ross: There you go.
Ross: Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.
Ross: High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.
Ross: You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Ross: ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Ross: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Ross: No.
Ross: Well, yeah!
Ross: (shyly) You grow up.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower) 
Ross: Hi. (kisses her)
Ross: How’d did it go?
Ross: I’m so proud of you.
Ross: Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.
Ross: Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Ross: Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Ross: Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)
Ross: (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her! 
Ross: Why? 
Ross: Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. 
Ross: Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound) 
Ross: Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch? 
Ross: Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? 
Ross: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? 
Ross: She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do? 
Ross: Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. 
Ross: Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. 
Ross: (on phone) Hi, is Rachel there? 
Ross: This is Ross? 
Ross: Of Ross and Rachel. 
Ross: Oh hey, hey Mark. 
Ross: Okay. 
Ross: Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone? 
Ross: Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office? 
Ross: Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? 
Ross: What? 
Ross: Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.) 
Ross: Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number. (hangs up) 
Ross: It's from Ross, it's a love bug. 
Ross: I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! 
Ross: I mean my God... 
Ross: ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!! 
Ross: I would never do that! 
Ross: Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. 
Ross: Why?! How?! How is he a genius? 
Ross: What am I going to do? 
Ross: I don't know you guys. 
Ross: All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! 
Ross: What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!! 
Ross: I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.) 
Ross: (entering) Hi. 
Ross: (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot. 
Ross: A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me. 
Ross: Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. 
Ross: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
Ross: Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. 
Ross: Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. 
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay? 
Ross: Ahh, no. 
Ross: Are you jealous? 
Ross: You are totally jealous. 
Ross: Honey, I love you too. 
Ross: What? 
Ross: Huh. 
Ross: What are you doing?
Ross: No thanks. I’m 29.
Ross: Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?
Ross: Oh come on, not again.
Ross: Hmm.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Ross: And what are you going to do for him?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: So, are you gonna see him again?
Ross: Naked friends.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Yeah, make that three.
Ross: Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?
Ross: What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
Ross: What?!
Ross: Are you sure? (Chandler nods: Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch) I’m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Ross: Okay.
Ross: No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down and looks up Robert’s shorts, seeing Robert’s package.) 
Ross: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ross: Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Ross: Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.
Ross: Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?
Ross: Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.
Ross: Good.
Ross: Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He stops and thinks about what he just said.)
Ross: (to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to...
Ross: Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he’s dancing) y'know, and you’re more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Hello. 
Ross: Yeah, huh. 
Ross: What?
Ross: Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Ross: (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Ross: Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’
Ross: Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Ross: Oh, well...
Ross: Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Ross: Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Ross: Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Ross: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Ross: Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Ross: What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.
Ross: (to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm) You’re so pretty. I love you.
Ross: (entering) So I nodded off a little.
Ross: Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Ross: First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.
Ross: Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Ross: No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)
Ross: No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.
Ross: That’s a little clearer.
Ross: Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)
Ross: Is everything okay?
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Ross: What is ah, Rach in her room?
Ross: Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?
Ross: What’s that on the bottom?
Ross: Hey, honey.
Ross: Hey, what’s going on?
Ross: What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Ross: (entering, carrying a basket) Hi!
Ross: Well you said you couldn’t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the basket)
Ross: Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Ross: Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here. (lights a candle)
Ross: Yeah!!
Ross: (stopping grinding) Pepper?
Ross: Okay sorry, whew.
Ross: (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Ross: I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross: Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?
Ross: What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Ross: Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.
Ross: Yeah, but wait...
Ross: Hey.
Ross: No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Ross: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Ross: Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I. 
Ross: Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Ross: No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!
Ross: Yes.
Ross: No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.
Ross: Is this about Mark?
Ross: Okay, it’s not, it’s not.
Ross: Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Ross: Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
Ross: Oh, hi Chloe.
Ross: Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.
Ross: What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Ross: Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?
Ross: Hi! It’s me.
Ross: Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this? 
Ross: Who’s that?
Ross: Is that Mark?
Ross: Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)
Ross: Ah, that’s okay, thanks.
Ross: Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Ross: (to Chloe) I like this song.
Ross: Oh, no, no.
Ross: I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Ross: Is this about Mark?
Ross: Okay, it’s not, it’s not.
Ross: Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)
Ross: (on the phone) I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this? 
Ross: Who’s that?
Ross: Is that Mark?
Ross: Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)
Ross: Yeah!!
Ross: Na-huh.
Ross: I love you.
Ross: Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
Ross: Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!
Ross: Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?
Ross: Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!
Ross: You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)
Ross: Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! 
Ross: Yeah! 
Ross: Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks up her coat)
Ross: Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!
Ross: Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Ross: Yes, you can, very much.
Ross: (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
Ross: You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.
Ross: What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Ross: Yeah, but don’t you think....
Ross: Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)
Ross: What trail?
Ross: Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.
Ross: (entering) Chloe? Hi.. 
Ross: You took my watch?
Ross: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Ross: Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?
Ross: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...
Ross: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Ross: Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.
Ross: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Ross: Actually, no, we’re not.
Ross: No, we’re not.
Ross: No, we’re not!!
Ross: Right.
Ross: Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.
Ross: (entering out of breath) Jasmine? 
Ross: We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.
Ross: Yes, I did.
Ross: Very bad.
Ross: I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Ross: Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Ross: Thank you, thank you.
Ross: (angrily) Who’s your roommate?
Ross: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Ross: (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Ross: Rachel?
Ross: No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Ross: No!!
Ross: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Ross: What?
Ross: She was...
Ross: She, she was different.
Ross: Nobody likes change.
Ross: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Ross: I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Ross: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Ross: Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up. 
Ross: That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Ross: Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Ross: Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
Ross: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Ross: Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
Ross: (pause) Yes I would.
Ross: (less sure) Yes.
Ross: (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.
Ross: What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?
Ross: Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’
Ross: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.
Ross: No anchovies.
Ross: That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.
Ross: You can have the last piece, if you want.
Ross: What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!
Ross: Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Ross: That’s what?!
Ross: Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Ross: Okay, okay, okay.
Ross: What?
Ross: (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...
Ross: Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....
Ross: (crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.
Ross: Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Ross: Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!
Ross: No, no, no, this weekend guys!
Ross: What’s going on?
Ross: So, for the whole weekend?
Ross: Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Ross: What a pity stay?
Ross: Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Ross: Where’s Ben?
Ross: Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Ross: Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Ross: Ah! (realises) Oh.
Ross: Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Ross: Yeah, well.
Ross: Oh yeah, I’d love that.
Ross: I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)
Ross: ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Ross: (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?
Ross: Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Ross: Oh, now you want a favour?
Ross: Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Ross: No, I’m not gonna pick them up.
Ross: No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....
Ross: Yeah, you’re right.
Ross: We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. (hangs up)
Ross: Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.
Ross: He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Ross: Excuse me?
Ross: (sarcastic) Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?
Ross: Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Ross: All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.
Ross: You’re welcome.
Ross: We were on a break!
Ross: Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
Ross: That’s what you said last night.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Obviously not to Joey.
Ross: (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Ross: I can.
Ross: Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Ross: No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: That would be great.
Ross: I know!
Ross: (entering) Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
Ross: Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.
Ross: Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Ross: (outside the door) So I’m gonna take off then!
Ross: Pffhah.
Ross: Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Ross: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Ross: Here you go.
Ross: Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)
Ross: Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Ross: And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Ross: Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Ross: Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
Ross: All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.
Ross: Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.
Ross: No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.
Ross: No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Ross: It didn’t.
Ross: Yeah, yeah.
Ross: Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Ross: Oh, no! No!
Ross: I’m the ring bearer.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Ross: Still?!
Ross: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Ross: (entering) Hello.
Ross: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Ross: Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Ross: Then be supportive like a guy.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: You ah, wanted to see me?
Ross: What?!
Ross: What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Ross: Yes. 
Ross: Yes, I do.
Ross: Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Ross: It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Ross: No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.
Ross: I’m just trying to help you, move on.
Ross: Petty...
Ross: Petty...
Ross: Petty...
Ross: Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)
Ross: Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
Ross: I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)
Ross: Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Ross: Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)
Ross: You bug me.
Ross: I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Ross: Hey, it’s been like three weeks!
Ross: Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.
Ross: She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!
Ross: Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Ross: I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Ross: Look, they must be stopped!
Ross: I need juice! People need juice!!
Ross: People need juice!
Ross: Juice, I need...
Ross: Yeah, okay. 
Ross: It’s just I miss her so much.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
Ross: We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Ross: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Ross: You get the dollhouse.
Ross: Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Ross: Sure, what’s up?
Ross: I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
Ross: Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!
Ross: Hey, what’s this?!
Ross: This is the coolest house ever!!
Ross: I would!
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: It’s a little early to be drinkin’.
Ross: Ohhhhh!
Ross: Mon?
Ross: Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!
Ross: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.
Ross: No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: (triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!
Ross: Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
Ross: Thanks. You ready to go?
Ross: (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Ross: Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...
Ross: Right.
Ross: (to Monica) You like it right?
Ross: Okay, good bye! (leaves)
Ross: (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
Ross: (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This blue suit, or this brown one?
Ross: Really? (Joey gives him a ‘Like I would know’ look)
Ross: Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Ross: Oh my God, is that still...
Ross: No you’re not.
Ross: Rach!
Ross: (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
Ross: And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Ross: Rach...
Ross: Rachel...
Ross: Fine. I’ll go.
Ross: (He checks his watch) Sure. I’ll help you.
Ross: Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He doesn’t like how it tastes.)
Ross: Okay. This stuff? 
Ross: All right.
Ross: Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
Ross: Sorry.
Ross: Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...
Ross: I’m sweeping...
Ross: Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she has a black eye.)
Ross: What? What?
Ross: No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachel is shocked) What?
Ross: Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)
Ross: (blows it) Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Ross: There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Ross: Yep?
Ross: Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Ross: (checks his watch) Sure, okay.
Ross: What?
Ross: Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Ross: Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Ross: All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
Ross: Ah, I’m sorry.
Ross: Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!
Ross: Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king. 
Ross: Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.
Ross: Yowzah!!!
Ross: Aww, come on.
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: All right.
Ross: Look...
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Rach?
Ross: Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a cab.
Ross: (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Ross: Okay? (goes into the living room)
Ross: (rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?
Ross: Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.
Ross: (to Chandler) That’s a duck.
Ross: Oh, it was, nah, well....
Ross: Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her apartment) Easy.
Ross: I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Ross: What?
Ross: (breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.
Ross: So, I’ll umm...
Ross: No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Ross: Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Ross: Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.
Ross: Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Ross: All right, I’ll see you tonight.
Ross: Hey, hey Rach!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Good.
Ross: So it’s looks like we’re the first ones here.
Ross: Yay!!
Ross: Hey. Oh, I’m sorry, this is Cailin.
Ross: And! Break!!
Ross: Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Ross: Well y'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Ross: Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…
Ross: Oh! Yeah. 
Ross: Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me, I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Ross: (looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…
Ross: No, I’m good. (He sits down, stunned.)
Ross: (drags Chandler over to buffet table) I’m telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s baaad news!
Ross: Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. (He’s watching very intently)
Ross: Go? Why?
Ross: But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Ross: Uh, oh-ho bye.
Ross: One.
Ross: Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Ross: No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Ross: No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a ‘Come on’ look) I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Ross: Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine. (starts to leave)
Ross: You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy) 
Ross: Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Ross: Umm…
Ross: Okay, it’s coffee.
Ross: It’s-it’s hot…
Ross: (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Ross: No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!
Ross: I can’t believe no one believes me!
Ross: You do Pheebs?
Ross: Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
Ross: No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Ross: Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)
Ross: Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his thing.)
Ross: Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump back.)
Ross: Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Ross: Ahhh.
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Ross: Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Ross: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Ross: At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Ross: (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!
Ross: Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Ross: Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Ross: No?
Ross: Well then, what is it?!
Ross: Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Ross: Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Ross: Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Ross: Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.
Ross: Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.
Ross: Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so...
Ross: What’s a koondis?
Ross: I guess it’s worth a try.
Ross: What?! What?!
Ross: We?! We angered it?!
Ross: Oh God!
Ross: Ow!! 
Ross: What was, what was that?
Ross: What?! How’s that?
Ross: Hey! (congratulates him)
Ross: What happened?
Ross: Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Ross: Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Ross: (on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.
Ross: (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?
Ross: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.
Ross: (walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!
Ross: Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Ross: Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Ross: All right! You go get him! Let’s go!
Ross: Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
Ross: Hot dog?
Ross: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.
Ross: No, I-I’m saying I liked her.
Ross: Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.
Ross: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Ross: Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Ross: Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.
Ross: That’s too bad.
Ross: Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Ross: Yeah, I think she looks good.
Ross: Go, go, go!
Ross: Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Ross: No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a “Please?” look.) No way! 
Ross: Yeah well, if ah, if that’s the rule this weekend... (She gets up) No!
Ross: Get away!
Ross: Stay away!
Ross: (he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape attempt he crushes Chandler’s sand castle) No!
Ross: Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Ross: Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let’s see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Ross: Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Good morning.
Ross: (to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Ross: Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Ross: Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.)
Ross: Nooo, but it, but it’s great.
Ross: Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that’s right, that’s right, it was you!
Ross: She said you gave her the razor!
Ross: Ahh, no, I’m good.
Ross: Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Ross: You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
Ross: You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Ross: Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?
Ross: You still love me?
Ross: You still love me.
Ross: Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Ross: What?!
Ross: What?
Ross: That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
Ross: I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Ross: Good night.
Ross: Okey-dokey!
Ross: Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and she’s cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
Ross: (surprised) Hi!
Ross: Awww.
Ross: Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
Ross: I know.
Ross: (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.
Ross: Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Ross: Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.
Ross: No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Ross: Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
Ross: Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: It’s over.
Ross: Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Ross: Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)
Ross: Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.
Ross: Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Ross: Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)
Ross: Done!
Ross: Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
Ross: I’m sorry.
Ross: Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.
Ross: (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.
Ross: Oh, sure! I’m sure.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What happened?
Ross: It does. It really and truly does.
Ross: (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
Ross: She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Ross: Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”
Ross: (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Ross: What the hell happened on that beach?!
Ross: (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Ross: What happened? Joey?
Ross: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Ross: I missed you too.
Ross: (getting miffed) I suppose.
Ross: (getting angry) Umm-hmm.
Ross: (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Ross: And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Ross: I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
Ross: I fell asleep!
Ross: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
Ross: Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Ross: Who’s Chip?
Ross: The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Ross: Monica, you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!
Ross: (to Rachel) I was just leaving.
Ross: Why? Did you write it?
Ross: Well ah, actually...
Ross: Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?
Ross: Oh, I’m sure.
Ross: (whispering in her ear) Oh, that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing! 
Ross: (reading the newspaper) Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Ross: I’m reading your ad.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Good, so do I
Ross: Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
Ross: So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Ross: So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Ross: So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?
Ross: Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!
Ross: No you don’t. 
Ross: No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.
Ross: I do not always have to be—okay, okay. (starts to leave)
Ross: (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.
Ross: Yes, we have to tell her!
Ross: (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Ross: (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Ross: Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Ross: No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Ross: None.
Ross: I’m sorry.
Ross: I don’t know what to say.
Ross: (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.
Ross: Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.
Ross: Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.
Joey, Rachel, and Ross: Hey!
Ross: The volcano?
Ross: With such a sad history.
Ross: So why don’t you quit?
Ross: Who is Maria?
Ross: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Ross: So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
Ross: They make you take an oath?
Ross: Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Ross: One more time, "Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Ross: Good! That’s good!
Ross: Me? No.
Ross: It’s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)
Ross: No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Ross: And that’s funny, why?
Ross: Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Ross: And that’s not against your oath?!
Ross: Hello.
Ross: We’d like to close our accounts.
Ross: No-no.
Ross: No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Ross: (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)
Ross: Oh, mine's December...
Ross: Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Ross: (loudly) Good luck!
Ross: Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Ross: Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: (loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Ross: Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Ross: Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)
Ross: Monica knows.
Ross: Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Wow! You-you look great!
Ross: (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.
Ross: Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Ross: What?
Ross: I-I-I...
Ross: Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Ross: Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)
Ross: Pheebs, what are you doing?
Ross: Are you serious?
Ross: (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Ross: At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Ross: You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Ross: Fine.
Ross: Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.

Ross: Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.
Ross: Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease… (plays air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Ross: Well umm, y’know, I used to play.
Ross: Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?
Ross: No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)
Ross: Okay, guys.
Ross: Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…
Ross: Really?! I mean, really?!!
Ross: Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so… (starts to break up and leaves)
Ross: (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time…
Ross: (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys…
Ross: (to Phoebe) Hey!
Ross: Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Ross: Pheebs…
Ross: See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.
Ross: Yeah, okay.
Ross: Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Ross: What?
Ross: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.
Ross: Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Ross: Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Ross: Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it. Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?
Ross: Yeah, like I could lose it.
Ross: I played bad on purpose guys.
Ross: Yeah—no, just that last song.
Ross: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Ross: Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that.
Ross: Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Ross: So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Ross: Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Ross: Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Ross: Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Ross: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Ross: Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: What are you doing?
Ross: Everything? Even the TV?
Ross: Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Ross: That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Ross: You’ve sentenced him?!
Ross: Joey, the guy’s your best friend.
Ross: Oh, who? Me?
Ross: Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Ross: I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Ross: He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Ross: (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Ross: I just wanna check something.
Ross: (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’ll see.
Ross: (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Ross: Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Ross: What did you get?
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?
Ross: Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Ross: There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Ross: I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Ross: He’s taking her purse!
Ross: What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Ross: I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Ross: Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Ross: Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Ross: Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
Ross: I’m gonna call after you!
Chandler and Ross: Woooo!!!
Ross: Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Ross: Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Ross: (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
Chandler and Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Ross: Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Ross: What happened?
Ross: Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Ross: It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.
Ross: No! I balanced my checkbook. 
Ross: I can’t believe he didn’t come!
Ross: Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Ross: There’s other stuff too.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah!!
Ross: It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!
Joey and Ross: Yeah!!!
Ross: (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Okay.
Chandler and Ross: Yeah.
Ross: I’m kinda beat.
Chandler and Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah, me too.
Ross: I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.
Ross: How sad are we?
Joey and Ross: Yeah!
Chandler and Ross: Yeah!
Ross: And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Ross: Hey! 
Ross: I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?
Ross: 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles, no!)
Ross: Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Ross: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Ross: No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Ross: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Ross: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Ross: Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.
Ross: Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: I wasn’t sleeping.
Ross: The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.
Ross: No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
Ross: Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.
Ross: (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
Ross: What?
Ross: (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
Ross: Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Ross: What?
Ross: Uh actually Joey, it’s the Cretasous period.
Ross: My God!
Ross: Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else!
Ross: Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Ross: That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!
Ross: And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes.
Ross: Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Ross: Just go for it Chandler.
Ross: That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with you later, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)
Ross: (entering) Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
Ross: But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Ross: It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Ross: Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I’m having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me.
Ross: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat and throws it down.) I’m Ross! I’m divorced, and I have a kid!
Ross: All right, there you go!
Ross: Okay, good-good for you.
Ross: Wow, Rhonda.
Ross: Yeah, okay, Scott!
Ross: Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Ross: Now, how will they know if you’re ready?
Ross: (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You’re good. (Tries a cookie.) These are not.
Ross: Five.
Ross: Challenge extended.
Ross: Challenge excepted.
Ross: We’ll be starting with apples.
Ross: Yes. Yes. Yes. (They’re perfect so far.)
Ross: They have another guess.
Ross: How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Ross: Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
Ross: No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
Ross: The test is ready.
Ross: Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It’s All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.
Ross: It’s heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category.
Ross: What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?
Ross: That’s correct. Ladies?
Ross: According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Ross: That is correct.
Ross: Gentlemen, you’re pick.
Ross: Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Ross: Althea is correct.
Ross: Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Ross: I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Ross: All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Ross: You don’t have to shout everything.
Ross: Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s father’s Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Ross: All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!
Ross: Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
Ross: 150 dollars.
Ross: 200 dollars.
Ross: Excuse me.
Ross: All right, gentlemen, you’re up first.
Ross: You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it (Chandler stops jumping)—now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Ross: Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
Ross: Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Ross: Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Ross: Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Ross: Two seconds…
Ross: 11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right, that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you’re up. 
Ross: 30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins…now! What is Joey’s favorite food?
Ross: Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
Ross: No, 19.
Ross: Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Ross: Correct, his profession was?
Ross: Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
Ross: 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Ross: Don’t blame the questions!
Ross: People can hear you.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: That is one good looking man!
Ross: Dude!
Ross: Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.
Ross: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: They’re not a couple!
Ross: Oh yeah!
Ross: No.
Ross: Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Ross: Oh no-no-no, I’m there.
Ross: Oh yeah!
Ross: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Ross: All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Ross: Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)
Ross: Okay, I… (Walks away.)
Ross: Uh, hello!
Ross: Oh, yumm!
Ross: Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!
Ross: Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Ross: Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)
Ross: So you were right?
Ross: Chandler!
Ross: He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.
Ross: How might you be wrong?
Ross: That’s all you’re basing this on?
Ross: So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: This is beautiful!
Ross: Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What are you saying?
Ross: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…
Ross: (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It’s the classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone knocked over a lamp.
Ross: Because there are naked ladies there.
Ross: There are naked ladies there too.
Ross: Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)
Ross: Are you kidding?!
Ross: He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: No.
Ross: You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Ross: All right, I’ll do it.
Ross: Please hurry.
Ross: When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Ross: I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!
Ross: Hey! You were so right!
Ross: Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other. 
Ross: I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…
Ross: Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda…y’know.
Ross: But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!
Ross: Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Ross: Happy for you. (He punches her back.)
Ross: No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Ross: Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Ross: Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!
Ross: Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it (In an English accent) football?
Ross: What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?
Ross: Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…
Ross: Cheers!
Ross: Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.
Ross: (shocked) Hey!
Ross: Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Ross: That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
Ross: And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Ross: Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.
Ross: Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!
Ross: Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
Ross: They don’t look any bigger than me!
Ross: All right.
Ross: Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!
Ross: Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Ross: You’ll see.
Ross: JOEY!!!!!!
Ross: Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Ross: (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water? 
Ross: Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m dying. I really do. 
Ross: (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Ross: (whines "No.") That’s not true!
Ross: What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!
Ross: I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Ross: No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Ross: I like that.
Ross: Huh?
Ross: All right, bad ankle, got it!
Ross: Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
Ross: But-but, Liam’s on my team.
Ross: I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)
Ross: Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket. 
Ross: No, not you. (Emily gets it.)
Ross: Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?
Ross: I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.
Ross: Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
Ross: No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.
Ross: It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.
Ross: Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Bye. (They kiss.)
Ross: Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.
Ross: Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.
Ross: Pheebs!
Ross: (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
Ross: Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.
Ross: You really didn’t know?
Ross: (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
Ross: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.
Ross: No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!"
Ross: Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)
Ross: Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Ross: What big thing?
Ross: (stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.
Ross: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Ross: That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Helps a little.
Ross: Yeah, have a seat.
Ross: That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?
Ross: What do you mean?
Ross: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
Ross: You think?
Ross: Hey, you’re right.
Ross: Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
Ross: Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Ross: Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…
Ross: (Thinks about it.) Nah.
Ross: Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"
Ross: And why do you care so much?
Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?
Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Ross: Ahh.
Ross: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?
Ross: What-what is love really?
Ross: I am a good kisser.
Ross: Emily! (Runs up.)
Ross: I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Ross: That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.
Ross: (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Ross: That’s no problem.
Ross: I did.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Ross: What do I do now?
Ross: She already lives in London.
Ross: Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.
Ross: (Answers the phone.) Hello?
Ross: Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Ross: No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.
Ross: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Ross: She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Ross: Well…
Ross: I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!
Ross: No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Ross: What?
Ross: I made fun of his accent.
Ross: No.
Ross: Really?
Ross: All right. All right, I’m gonna do it! 
Ross: I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.
Ross: (on phone) Hey.
Ross: No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Ross: About four hours.
Ross: (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Ohh! Thank you.
Ross: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ross: Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Ross: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Ross: Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.
Ross: I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol, Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Ross: Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…
Ross: Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: So uh, Emily called last night…
Ross: Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!
Ross: Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Ross: Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?
Ross: How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Ross: What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.
Ross: Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?
Ross: Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)
Ross: (opening the door.) Hey!
Ross: Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)
Ross: So umm, any word from Susan?
Ross: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Ross: Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Ross: Am I?!
Ross: Am I?!
Ross: Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Ross: OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!
Ross: (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! 
Ross: So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
Ross: Oh, wake up!
Ross: Excuse me?
Ross: Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Ross: What?
Ross: It does not!
Ross: This is not fun!
Ross: Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Ross: Nice luggage.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh, I missed you too.
Ross: (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
Ross: Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around, pretending like he’s jamming.)
Ross: Uh, I don’t know, whatever.
Ross: Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.
Ross: One more day, seriously/
Ross: So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Ross: Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)
Ross: Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
Ross: No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
Ross: (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)
Ross: Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Ross: I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Ross: Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
Ross: Yeah!! Yeah!
Ross: I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, "Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Ross: Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!
Ross: I could ask her to live with me!
Ross: I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Ross: Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?
Ross: I don’t want to do that.
Ross: Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (laughs) Move in with me.
Ross: Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
Ross: I know.
Ross: Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Ross: No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?
Ross: What?
Ross: No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?
Ross: Get married.
Ross: No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.
Ross: Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?
Ross: Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Ross: Yes! We’re getting married?!
Ross: Yes!
Ross: Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Ross: Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Ross: Come on! Come on. Come on.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Ross: We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Ross: (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…
Ross: Yeah. (They hug again.)
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Ross: Oh no, not yet.
Ross: Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Ross: Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London…
Ross: Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress… 
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: What’s wah-pah?
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Ross: So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Ross: I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda….. y’know.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: All right, I just wanted to check.
Ross: You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Ross: Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh…
Ross: Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet.
Ross: Oh. Yeah?
Ross: Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible.
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: I gotta get to work.
Ross: Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?
Ross: If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Ross: Yeah, all right, it’s a date. (He leaves)
Ross: (coming back in) Did you say something?
Ross: Hey man.
Ross: So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Ross: Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Ross: Yep!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know?
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?
Ross: Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.
Ross: What happened?
Ross: Noo. Why?
Ross: Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.
Ross: Come here.
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: You okay?
Ross: Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her some envelopes.)
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Sure. Why not?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?
Ross: Yeah sure.
Ross: Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Ross: Hi. 
Ross: You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Ross:  See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Ross: I do.
Ross: Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Ross: Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ross: Yes, yes, that's right...
Ross: What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!
Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Ross: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
Ross: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Ross: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Ross: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Ross: Fine.
Ross: Good.
Ross: No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.
Ross: Is this about Mark?
Ross: Okay, it’s not, it’s not.
Ross: Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Ross: Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
Ross: Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! 
Ross: Yeah! 
Ross: Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!
Ross: Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Ross: Yes, you can, very much.
Ross: (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
Ross: No!!
Ross: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Ross: What?
Ross: She was...
Ross: She, she was different.
Ross: Nobody likes change.
Ross: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Ross: WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Ross: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
Ross: You think?
Ross: Hey, you’re right.
Ross: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. 
Ross: Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up either. 
Ross:  Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y—(Rachel grabs the phone and hangs it up for him.)
Ross: Rach, I got a message from you.
Ross: You're over me?
Ross: Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ross: When, when were you... under me?
Ross: OK, I need to lie down. 
Ross: Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Ross: I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Ross: What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Ross: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Ross: Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?
Ross: You still love me?
Ross: What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Ross: What?!
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
Ross: You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Ross: Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
Ross: OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Ross: (walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on the endtable) Okay dad.
Ross: Yeah, well.
Ross: Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?
Ross: Hey guys!
Ross: All right, here’s the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving Emily) 
Ross: So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Ross: I sort’ve already asked Chandler.
Ross: Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer.
Ross: (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Ross: Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Ross: Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Ross: Great. Great.
Ross: Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Ross: Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Ross: Yeah, see, I don’t think it’s gonna that difficult considering this one won’t be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Ross: Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Ross: Okay, see ya later.
Ross: Hey listen man, about the stripper…
Ross: Good call!
Ross: Hey-hey, what are those?
Ross: Wow! Yeah!
Ross: Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.
Ross: Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Ross: I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…
Ross: Yeah, right!
Ross: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Ross: Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Ross: My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Ross: (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!
Ross: Not on you! On the stripper!
Ross: Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!
Ross: So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Ross: Diverse.
Ross: Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Ross: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Ross: Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
Ross: Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)
Ross: No, that’s all right.
Ross: Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys. 
Ross: Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting emotional.)
Ross: Total wuss!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey! Are you ready yet?
Ross: Oh! Got ‘em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!
Ross: Yeah, cheerie-o! 
Ross: Well, we’re all here! I guess we should get going!
Ross: Oh, I’ll-I’ll come hug you.
Ross: Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: (to Rachel) So, we’re off.
Ross: Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can’t believe you’re not gonna be there!
Ross: So-so come! Why don’t you come?
Ross: To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me.
Ross: Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?
Ross: This is my wedding.
Ross: Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.
Ross: All right, let’s go! Bye, Pheebs!
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?
Ross: What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!
Ross: Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Ross: Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?
Ross: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.
Ross: It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.
Ross: Uh-huh, I see that.
Ross: What? What?
Ross: Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Ross: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Ross: She said what?
Ross: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn’t right.
Ross: I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)
Ross: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
Ross: No. I’m saying it’s now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)
Ross: There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Ross: (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
Ross: Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Ross: Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Ross: Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Ross: Excuse me?
Ross: I don’t know. A month?
Ross: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Ross: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Ross: Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
Ross: Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…
Ross: But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want.
Ross: And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…
Ross: 
Ross:

Ross: 
Ross: 
Ross: 
Ross: 
Ross: I Ross...
Ross: Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.
Ross: I, Ross…
Ross: Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like there’d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)
Ross: As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)
Ross: Happy too.
Ross: Yay!
Ross: Okay.
Ross: (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn’t it?
Ross: (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the gang) She’s just fixing her makeup.
Ross: And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)
Ross: That’s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?
Ross: No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
Ross: But it absolutely didn’t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn’t!! It didn’t!!
Ross: (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!
Ross: Look, I’m sorry.
Ross: Oh, right!
Ross: (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)
Ross: (entering) Emily?!
Ross: No, I’ve looked everywhere!
Ross: No! For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I’m staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.
Ross: Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ross: (disappointed) That’s cool.
Ross: Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt.
Ross: Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)
Ross: Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Ross: Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.
Ross: Rach! Rach!
Ross: Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Not yet.
Ross: Pretty soon I guess.
Ross: I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?
Ross: Same difference.
Ross: I get it! Well, that’s that.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…
Ross: I could, yeah, I can do that.
Ross: I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Ross: I know, why not?
Ross: Right?
Ross: Y’know—thanks! (They hug)
Ross: Yeah, well…nah.
Ross: Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Ross: Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Ross: No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Ross: Okay!
Ross: Cool!
Ross: Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate agent.) Here. 
Ross: Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Ross: You tell them to wait!
Ross: Emily.
Ross: Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No! Emily!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Yeah! (They high-five.)
Ross: Ohh…
Ross: Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Ross: Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Ross: Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Ross: Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Ross: No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Ross: HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Ross: Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Ross: That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Ross: So, what? That's it?
Ross: Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)
Ross: (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: She's doing her laundry.
Ross: It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Ross: Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Ross: I can't catch a break!
Ross: What thing?
Ross: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.
Ross: Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Ross: Wait! It was my plan.
Ross: And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Ross: The paper.
Ross: Events from around the globe.
Ross: Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…
Ross: Yeah. 
Ross: Go ahead.
Ross: Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Ross: What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Ross: Why are you laughing?
Ross: Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Ross: Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know! 
Ross: Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…
Ross: That is what the thing is.
Ross: No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Ross: No thank you for… Thank you.
Ross: Okay, let's go!
Ross: Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Ross: It's all right.
Ross: Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Ross: Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Ross: Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Ross: Yeah, he's head of the department.
Ross: Hello.
Ross: Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Ross: To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…
Ross: Again, it's not that he…
Ross: Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Ross: (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Ross: Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Ross: I do too! I do too!
Ross: Argh!
Ross: Argh!
Ross: You did it, man.
Ross: I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Ross: (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross: (on phone) Hello.
Ross: Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily) Hi!
Ross: No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Ross: Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Ross: (to the gang, whispering) She's talking.
Ross: (entering) Hi!
Ross: Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Ross: In London!
Ross: She wants me to move to London.
Ross: I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Ross: It could happen.
Ross: All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Ross: Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Ross: Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Ross: All right, did you just say all right?
Ross: Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Ross: Yes, tell me.
Ross: I know. I am, I am so sorry.
Ross: Again, very sorry.
Ross: Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Ross: Oh that is so great! That's…
Ross: So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Ross: No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Ross: I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!
Ross: Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)
Ross: (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a…)
Ross: Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Ross: For what?
Ross: Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Ross: It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Ross: Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Ross: No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing what's going on.)
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Ross: Damn!
Ross: I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Ross: Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig of Pepto Bismol.)
Ross: I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Ross: So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Ross: Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…
Ross: What?!
Ross: Le Poo's still alive?!
Ross: Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Ross: Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!
Ross: You're nose is bleeding!
Ross: Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)
Ross: Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Ross: Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Ross: Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Ross: And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants… 
Ross: …is for me not to see you anymore.
Ross: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ross: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Ross: What are you doing?
Ross: Rachel, this is your apartment.
Ross: You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Ross: Yes! Please!
Ross: That's okay.
Ross: That's not advice!
Ross: I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
Ross: (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Ross: Hi.
Ross: I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Ross: No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Ross: Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Ross: I can't believe this is happening.
Ross: I am so sorry.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: How come? Everybody else does.
Ross: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Ross: Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Ross: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Ross: Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Ross: After what I did? Can you blame her?
Ross: (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Ross: Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Ross: Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Ross: Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Ross: (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. (Hangs up.)
Ross: No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
Ross: I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. (Points.)
Ross: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Ross: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…
Ross: Why?
Ross: What's going on?
Ross: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
Ross: Yep.
Ross: Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Ross: Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Ross: Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Ross: You do, huh?
Ross: What are you talking about?
Ross: Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross: Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Ross: Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
Ross: Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
Ross: Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Ross: (on phone) Hi.
Ross: (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Ross: Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Ross: Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Ross: So, can you trust me?
Ross: Well, I guess that's it.
Ross: My marriage is over.
Ross: Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Ross: Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Ross: Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Ross: Who needs a lease when it's family!
Ross: You got it.
Ross: Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Ross: What?
Ross: (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
Ross: Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Ross: Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!
Ross: Pretty cool, huh?
Ross: (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
Ross: (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
Ross: I'll take sports.
Ross: All right. Uhh, international.
Ross: Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Ross: (looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Ross: Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Ross: Okay, let's go.
Ross: Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Ross: Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)
Ross: I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Ross: (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Ross: (To Chandler) How about you?
Ross: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Ross: Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Ross: Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…
Ross: Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Ross: Are you guys sure about this?
Ross: All right.
Ross: So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the 'quiet down' maneuver).
Ross: (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
Ross: I couldn't possibly eat another bite. 
Ross: Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Ross: I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Ross: Oh God, no.
Ross: You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Ross: In this life, Phoebe.
Ross: Yeah that's the same.
Ross: (entering) Hey! 
Ross: Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Ross: Oh, this is Monica.
Ross: Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Ross: So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Ross: Well, that's cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
Ross: Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Ross: (in a high pitched voice) Monica!
Ross: So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night.
Ross: All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Ross: Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving! 
Ross: So uh, where's Monica?
Ross: Dude!
Ross: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Ross: Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
Ross: (To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Ross: Well, they're not mine!
Ross: Why are they here?
Ross: (entering, depressed) Hi.
Ross: Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Ross: My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross: Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Ross: (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. 
Ross: Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Ross: (entering) Phoebe! 
Ross: Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Ross: That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
Ross: Yeah, of course, Donald.
Ross: What?!
Ross: (Proudly) Yeah.
Ross: Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Ross: Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here… 
Ross: What?
Ross: You ate my sandwich?
Ross: (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Ross: Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Ross: (getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
Ross: (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
Ross: You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
Ross: (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross: MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
Ross: (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
Ross: I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Ross: On account of my rage.
Ross: He gave me a pill for it.
Ross: Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Ross: I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Ross: (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?
Ross: (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)
Ross: Yeah, what's going on?
Ross: You slept with my sister?
Ross: This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
Ross: My God Monica!!
Ross: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Ross: 
Ross: 
Ross: 
Ross: 
Ross: I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Ross: Or that.
Ross: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Ross: And it can't be Joey.
Ross: Or Joseph.
Ross: All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The official rulebook of Fireball.
Ross: This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Ross: (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. (To Joey) Now come on! 
Ross: No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! (After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
Ross: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Monica and Ross:
Ross: Oh-oh, yeah.
Ross: Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Ross: Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Oh fine.
Ross: Joey's not going.
Ross: Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Ross: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Ross: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Ross: And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Ross: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Ross: How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Ross: No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Ross: Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Ross: Yay!
Ross: I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Ross: All right. (Takes another copy.)
Ross: Hey man.
Ross: About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Ross: Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest… (Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Ross: I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.
Ross: (reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.
Ross: (hopping) 73! 72! 71!
Ross: What?
Ross: Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Ross: Awww, man! Really?
Ross: That's a good point.
Ross: Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Ross: All right.
Ross: Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Ross: (To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!
Ross: Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Ross: Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Ross: Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ross: In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
Ross: Ohh.
Ross: Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!
Ross: I just asked that girl out.
Ross: Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)
Ross: That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Ross: Hi, Pheebs!
Ross: Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's ear.) Hornswoggle.
Ross: All right, see you later.
Ross: (entering, with Ben) Hi!
Ross: Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Ross: (after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Ross: What are you, what are you doing?
Ross: What, to blind my child?
Ross: (talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot? 
Ross: Okay, it must just be me then.
Ross: That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Ross: Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)
Ross: (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….
Ross: 'Kay!
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: (calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Ross: Well, you can help me!
Ross: Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…
Ross: No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Ross: Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.) 
Ross: Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.) They're not coming on man.
Ross: Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Ross: Hold on.
Ross: They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Ross: What difference does that make?!
Ross: Dude, what am I gonna…
Ross: All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Ross: I had a problem.
Ross: This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Ross: Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
Ross: Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Ross: Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
Ross: (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Ross: Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Ross: (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Ross: No! No! No!
Ross: I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!
Ross: Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Ross: Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Ross: That's okay, Joe.
Ross: (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!
Ross: Just, y'know out.
Ross: I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Ross: Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Ross: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…
Ross: Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Ross: Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Ross: I am gonna see her again.
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Ross: Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice! 
Ross: Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Ross: Thanks!
Ross: Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Ross: Oh…
Ross: This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…
Ross: Okay. Sometimes I feel…
Ross: Huh?
Ross: Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Ross: OH…MY…GOD!!
Ross: I am now.
Ross: Dude, we got to talk.
Ross: I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?
Ross: Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: All right.
Ross: (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.
Ross: Sorry.
Ross: (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Ross: Is everything okay?
Ross: Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Ross: Your make-up!
Ross: What's the part, Anti-man?
Ross: Hey, how are you holding up?
Ross: What happened?
Ross: Wh-what did he say?!
Ross: Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! (Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.
Ross: Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Ross: What kind of problem?
Ross: Nooooo!
Ross: Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Ross: Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Ross: It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Ross: Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Ross: (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)
Ross: (entering) What's going on?
Ross: What?! What?!
Ross: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Ross: No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to 
Ross: No.
Ross: No.
Ross: A basket of mini-muffins.
Ross: The small one.
Ross: Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Ross: Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)
Ross: Noooo.
Ross: Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Ross: Huh?
Ross: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Ross: Well, he had gravity boots.
Ross: Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Ross: Right. (Exits.)
Ross: Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Ross: A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
Ross: Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Ross: Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I—What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Ross: Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Ross: What the hell are doing?!!
Ross: (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Ross: (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Ross: What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Ross: (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)
Ross: Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…
Ross: You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Ross: (opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!
Ross: Aww.
Ross: Huh.
Ross: Ohh.
Ross: Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Ross: Howard?
Ross: Oh that's nice.
Ross: Oh. Uhh…
Ross: No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.
Ross: Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Ross: No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Ross: Yes but too me he's just, man.
Ross: (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Ross: …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Ross: It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Ross: Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
Ross: Oh, no!
Ross: Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Ross: Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
Ross: What are you doing?
Ross: You chipped in?!
Ross: Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Ross: Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Ross: (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
Ross: (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
Ross: Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Ross: So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Ross: Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
Ross: What?!
Ross: (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!
Ross: Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Ross: Oh-no. No. No.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Ross: No, I will not!
Ross: You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Ross: This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Come here to me!"
Ross: No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Ross: Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the couch.)
Ross: Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the store.)
Ross: What's that supposed to mean?
Ross: Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Ross: Yeah! Rach?
Ross: Then tell him quickly.
Ross: Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Ross: A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!
Ross: Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)
Ross: Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Ross: Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the railing.)
Ross: Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay. You got it?
Ross: Good-good-good. 
Ross: Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? 
Ross: Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Ross: Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Ross: Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Ross: Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.) 
Ross: Oh, that's me.
Ross: No! That's-that's my arm!
Ross: Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. 
Ross: Come on, Chandler. 
Ross: All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!
Ross: All right, ready?
Ross: Turn.
Ross: Turn! Turn!
Ross: Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Ross: Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Ross: All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Ross: I can't believe that didn't work!
Ross: I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Ross: That's what I'm telling you.
Ross: This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Ross: Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Ross: (thinks) I take it.
Ross: Hey! What's up?
Ross: Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Ross: Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)
Ross: Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey just stares at him) I'm Ross.
Ross: You got ink on your lip.
Ross: (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!
Ross: (to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't? 
Ross: I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Ross: Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)
Ross: I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…
Ross: Jen, I know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise) But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…
Ross: Umm?
Ross: I will give you a call.
Ross: Okay!
Ross: So uhh, you ready?
Ross: Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.) Joey…
Ross: (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot and waves at the cutouts.)
Ross: Hi!
Ross: (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Ross: I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…
Ross: (from the bathroom) Okay!!
Ross: All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Ross: You're not his godfather.
Ross: (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.
Ross: Really? That's great!
Ross: Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)
Ross: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Ross: (entering, downtrodden) Hi.
Ross: Not so good.
Ross: (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Ross: Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Ross: Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah, it is.
Ross: No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Ross: Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What's up?
Ross: Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Ross: Well, you just…
Ross: What?!
Ross: Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Ross: What?!
Ross: And why wouldn't he get it?
Ross: Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Ross: Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Ross: You're kid's name is Raymond!
Ross: (entering, angrily) Joey!
Ross: (angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Ross: No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Ross: Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
Ross: I think, sub-consciously…
Ross: (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Ross: No!
Ross: There you go. Thank you!
Ross: No.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Ross: Wow! How'd you get in there?
Ross: What the hell was that?!
Ross: The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
Ross: It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney, nasally noises.)"
Ross: Yeah, right.
Ross: (backing away) I'm good.
Ross: And on your anniversary, for shame!
Ross: Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Ross: Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Ross: Well…
Ross: Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Ross: And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
Ross: This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Ross: I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Ross: (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Ross: You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Ross: You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
Ross: This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Ross: Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Ross: Really?!
Ross: And thank you, for that.
Ross: What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Ross: All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!
Ross: (smiling) Are you sure?
Ross: (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Ross: Do you like it?
Ross: Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Ross: Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!
Ross: (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Ross: You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?
Ross: (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
Ross: Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
Ross: Gas? Wow! Intense.
Ross: (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Ross: They put that in.
Ross: The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Ross: A lot of other gas smells…
Ross: Meth-methane smells…
Ross: Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Ross: (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
Ross: Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: What do you mean?
Ross: And she just gave you this?
Ross: Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Ross: Well that I can believe.
Ross: (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
Ross: Hm-mmm.
Ross: (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. (Joey panics.) 
Ross: (turning and looking) What? Where?
Ross: What am I looking at?
Ross: Me too!
Joey and Ross:
Ross: Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Ross: (to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
Ross: (to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Ross: Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
Ross: It's the—Chandler!!
Ross: So where are we going next?
Ross: Yeah, no one talks like that!
Ross: Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Ross: Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Ross: Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
Ross: Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)
Ross: Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Ross: What is it?
Ross: What? What? What? What is it?
Ross: Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Ross: (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
Ross: Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…
Ross: Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Ross: Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Ross: And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Ross: Wow! I could've died tonight.
Ross: I do have a newfound respect for life.
Ross: Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Ross: Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
Ross: The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Ross: Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? 
Ross: And somebody took a shot at me!
Ross: No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Ross: (stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?
Ross: You talked to her?
Ross: Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Ross: Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Ross: Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ross: You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Ross: Huh.
Ross: That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Ross: Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Ross: Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)
Ross: Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. 
Ross: (on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
Ross: (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Ross: Yeah, I want my money back.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Ross: I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Ross: I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Ross: Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ross: (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an island.
Ross: (looks at his watch) 2:17.
Ross: Are you serious?!
Ross: Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Joey and Ross:
Ross: You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Joey and Ross:
Ross: What-what is it?!
Ross: Why is it inside out?!
Ross: How much did you pay for that?
Ross: Yeah? How much?
Ross: ON A CAT??!!!!
Ross: Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Ross: (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Ross: What?
Ross: I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?
Ross: …now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Ross: How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Ross: Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Ross: 2 hours, 27 minutes.
Ross: Hey Rach!
Ross: Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Ross: (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Ross: It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Ross: All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
Ross: Baking it didn't help, huh?
Ross: I'm starving! 
Ross: I'm still hungry! 
Ross: I am!
Ross: Oh, thank God!
Ross: I know. My arm is killing me.
Ross: What's going on?
Ross: Oh God, here we go!
Ross: Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
Ross: Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes his eye)
Ross: All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Ross: All right, bye!
Ross: Later! (Exits.)
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Ross: I don't know, umm…
Ross: What's with her?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Action.
Ross: Dude, you are sick.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Ross: All right!
Ross: Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away) Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He grabs the magazine away from her.)
Ross: Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Ross: Well, I don't know.
Ross: Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Ross: Okay. So we're, we're good?
Ross: All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Ross: ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
Ross: Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Ross: Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Ross: Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Ross: Yeah? Sometimes it's… (Does the fist thing.)
Ross: Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Ross: What do you like better flora or fauna?
Ross: Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Ross: Why are you mad at me?
Ross: When did I say you were boring?!
Ross: Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Ross: Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Ross: What'd you say?
Ross: Is that supposed to be an insult?
Ross: So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Ross: Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)
Ross: (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Ross: Hey.
Ross: May I come in?
Ross: Do you want me too?
Ross: So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.) This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)
Ross: The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)
Ross: Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Ross: You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Ross: No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other one and heads for the door.)
Ross: Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)
Ross: (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!
Ross: Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Ross: Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Ross: What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Ross: Is that so?
Ross: (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
Ross: (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)
Ross: What the? What…
Ross: Ohh, it was the best!
Ross: I think the check in is that way. (Points)
Ross: Phoebe! (They hug.) 
Ross: Hey, you wet my pants!
Ross: Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction. Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
Ross: What?
Ross: Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
Ross: What? No-no, a lurker.
Ross: Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…
Ross: No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Ross: Uh-hmm.
Ross: My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.
Ross: Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)
Ross: What?!
Ross: Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Ross: Joey!!
Ross: (To Joey) Thanks man.
Ross: Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Ross: Your what?
Ross: What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Ross: (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you. (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.
Ross: Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So…(Rachel stares at him.) Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Ross: Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross: Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) There are tons…of…freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Ross: Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Ross: Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big drink! 
Ross: (looking at the price list) Umm… Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Ross: Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Ross: (gets up) All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.
Ross: (does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)
Ross: You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)
Ross: (runs out of cards) We need more cards.
Ross: That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.) 
Ross: Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)
Ross: I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Ross: Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Ross: (he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the bed.)
Ross: I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I…I really miss downstairs.
Ross: Well hello! I'm Ross!
Ross: Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
Ross: (bowing) Hello!
Ross: Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
Ross:
Ross: Why are we in bed together?
Ross: (checks) Yeah.
Ross: No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Ross: And we didn’t have sex. 
Ross: (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has "Just Married" written on his back.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
Ross: We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
Ross: I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Ross: Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment. 
Ross: What?
Ross: No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Ross: I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
Ross: Yes, exactly!
Ross: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
Ross: I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Ross: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
Ross: I’m asking you to do me a favor. 
Ross: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Ross: I don’t know if it’s true.
Ross: Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Ross: All right. All right, I’ll do it.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.
Ross: Oh yeah, why not?
Ross: Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Ross: I didn’t get the annulment.
Ross: We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.
Ross: Oh yeah, why not?
Ross: Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Ross: I didn’t get the annulment.
Ross: We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?
Ross: I know.
Ross: Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Ross: Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!
Ross: Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?
Ross: Hey! Hi!
Ross: What’s up?
Ross: Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)
Ross: Bye.
Ross: Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!
Ross: (interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Ross: Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Ross: What?! Why?
Ross: And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
Ross: …once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.
Ross: What?!
Ross: This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Ross: We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Ross: (to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.
Ross: (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!
Ross: Yes.
Ross: Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross: Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…
Ross: Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Ross: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Ross: I think just the annulment for today.
Ross: Easy.
Ross: No problem.
Ross: Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Ross: Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
Ross: Oh no.
Ross: I couldn’t.
Ross: It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
Ross: I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Ross: I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
Ross: Ohh, what’s wrong?!
Ross: Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.
Ross: Of course.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Ross: No. 
Ross: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
Ross: It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Ross: It’s also a sign of friendship.
Ross: (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
Ross: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ross: I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Ross: (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Ross: Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Ross: Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number.
Ross: Okay, you go grab it!
Ross: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Ross: Look, I do not re-love her.
Ross: Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ross: You can live with me.
Ross: What?
Ross: Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
Ross: Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.
Ross: Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.
Ross: Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?
Ross: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Ross: What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?
Ross: What?! Over a stupid room!
Ross: Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!
Ross: What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Ross: Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Ross: (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Ross: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Ross: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?
Ross: (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)
Ross: (entering) Hey Rach!
Ross: You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?
Ross: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Ross: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Ross: No!
Ross: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Ross: Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Ross: Really?! We are?
Ross: Ohh! That would be great.
Ross: (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn’t think of that.
Ross: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!
Ross: No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!
Ross: Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel’s room) could destroy you!!
Ross: Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that’s what you want, there’s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON’T DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
Ross: (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?
Ross: Fighting?!
Ross: Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?
Ross: Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
Ross: Yeah, I’m-I’m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)
Ross: I’ve been back and forth.
Ross: Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys.
Ross: Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.
Ross: Is that what I want?
Ross: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Ross: How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
Ross: (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Ross: Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Ross: (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
Ross: (on phone) No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Ross: Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it. 
Ross: I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Ross: (entering) Hey everyone!
Ross: Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Ross: (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…"
Ross: (continuing) "…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…"
Ross: No! Why?
Ross: Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) into…"
Ross: Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!
Ross: (gets up) Okay!
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: Please don’t say naked chicks.
Ross: I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Ross: (entering) Hello!
Ross: It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Ross: I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Ross: That’s right!
Ross: (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
Ross: Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Ross: Will you-will you please?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: (in his British accent) I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister.
Ross: (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
Ross: Just please stop!
Ross: (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Ross: They’re not listening too me?
Ross: Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Ross: (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
Ross: (British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…
Ross: (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!
Ross: Look I was going to tell you!
Ross: Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.
Ross: Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. (He laughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.
Ross: Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Ross: Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.
Ross: Okay Rach, but…
Ross: Look I told you…
Ross: Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!
Ross: What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ross: Fine, I’m mentally unstable.
Ross: What?!
Ross: Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
Ross: Oh, come on!
Ross: Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
Ross: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Ross: (stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Ross: And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.) Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Ross: That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Ross: The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)
Ross: I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.
Ross: Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Ross: Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Ross: Yeah! Right!
Ross: You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?
Ross: Okay, can we just sign please?
Ross: Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)
Ross: What?
Ross: Excuse me?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your fault.
Ross: I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Ross: Did I, did I even treat?
Ross: That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
Ross: Eh, no problem.
Ross: Totally. (Exits.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Ross: I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Ross: Oh, but-but I can’t do it.
Ross: Because, because I’ve got Ben.
Ross: Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Ross: (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Ross: Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
Ross: Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Ross: (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how’s the packing going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.
Ross: And now you want that money back.
Ross: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)
Ross: I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Ross: Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Ross: No.
Ross: So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Ross: Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
Ross: So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Ross: Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Ross: Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Ross: Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?
Ross: Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Ross: Put it back exactly where you found it?
Ross: ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Ross: Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Ross: Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Ross: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Ross: Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.
Ross: Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Ross: Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Ross: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Ross: Hey, I've been married 3 times
Ross: Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Ross: Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 
Ross: Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Ross: Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
Ross: They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Ross: (nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.
Ross: Who cares? I repel women.
Ross: (whispers) What?!
Ross: Why does anyone have to be naked?
Ross: I-I had to show Chandler something?
Ross: Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Ross: Dude, what'd you have?
Ross: (realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Ross: So really, what'd ya have?
Ross: Bye! (Runs out)
Ross: So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Ross: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.

Ross:
Ross: (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!
Ross: (not paying attention) Yeah, they don’t like you.
Ross: I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-
Ross: (trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!
Ross: For real?
Ross: Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Joey and Ross: Hey!
Ross: And the place looks so nice!
Ross: Happy Thanksgiving!
Ross: See ya!
Ross: Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
Ross: Some would say she’s attractive, yes.
Ross: (to Joey) Dude, we were good!
Ross: Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Ross: Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Ross: W-What was the one right before bananas?
Joey and Ross: (faking dissapointment) Okay.
Ross: Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Ross: Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Ross: Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!
Ross: No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.
Ross: Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Ross: (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Ross: Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.
Ross: Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Ross: I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.
Ross: How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Ross: I don’t know, I-I was all high. 
Ross: Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Ross: Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Ross: Okay, fine!
Ross: Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
Ross: What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Ross: Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)
Ross: Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Ross: So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm? 
Ross: And um...You look nice today.
Ross: What?
Ross: (shocked) Eh?
Ross: (cutting her off) You’re alone.
Ross: (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!
Ross: Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
Ross: It tastes like feet!
Ross: Are you kidding?
Ross: Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Ross: Wha-what?
Ross: (in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Ross: Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.
Ross: Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!
Ross: Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross: I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Ross: Hey
Ross: Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Ross: … and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Ross: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!
Ross: Hi Janine!
Ross: You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Ross: Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Ross: Are you serious?
Ross: Bye Janine!
Ross: It was a dry day.
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: Got it!
Ross: Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!
Monica and Ross: ‘Scuse us
Ross: Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Ross: Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Ross: Why do they keep doing that?
Ross: Right.
Ross: Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: We know!
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Monica! (Pause) Would it?
Ross: Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!
Ross: The routine!
Ross: Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!
Ross: We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Ross: So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?
Ross: Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Ross: No!
Ross: Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know? (He mimics a robot)
Ross: I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
Monica and Ross: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by Monica, but she moves out of the way)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: You kissed her.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: You like it? 
Ross: It’s my new apothecary table!
Ross: Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Ross: Why did you do that?
Ross: She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Ross: What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)
Ross: Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross: Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross: Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new…(On Rachel’s glare)…old sheet?
Ross: My apothecary table!!!
Ross: I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Ross: Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Ross: Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Ross: A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Ross: (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
Ross: Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)
Ross: Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Ross: She does want to.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Y’know what would cheer you up?
Ross: I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Ross: Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
Ross: Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.
Ross: (showing them the page) Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too.
Ross: What?
Ross: Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.
Ross: Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’
Ross: What?
Ross: Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?
Ross: No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.
Ross: It’s my joke.
Ross: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Ross: What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Ross: Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Ross: Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Ross: Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Ross: Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
Ross: (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Ross: Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Ross: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Ross: Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.
Ross: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Ross: It’s my joke.
Ross: Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Hey Mon.
Ross: Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.
Ross: We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me. 
Ross: See, I would never snap at you like that.
Ross: Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!
Ross: It’s your joke.
Ross: No way. 
Ross: Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?
Ross: Hey does anyone have any gum?
Ross: Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.
Ross: Hi Jill.
Ross: Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Ross: I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Phoebe and Ross:
Ross: Sorry-sorry Jill.
Ross: Huh? Oh, I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!
Ross: Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Ross: Ross, wants a pajmena?
Ross: It’s a rug. (Jill winces.)
Ross: Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)
Ross: Well. Hey…
Ross: Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I’m sorry!"
Ross: Oh stop.
Ross: No, you stop!
Ross: (entering) Rach? Hi!
Ross: Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Ross: Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Ross: Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Ross: I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Ross: (entering) Hi Jill!
Ross: Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
Ross: Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home, you’re-you’re-you’re right here.
Ross: Okay. So well I’ll umm, (To Rachel) I’ll have her home by midnight.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Ross: I guess so.
Ross: No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Ross: Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Ross: Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Ross: Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Ross: (while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay. (Rachel stops.) It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again.
Ross: I mean after tomorrow night.
Ross: Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
Ross: You want me to call her right now?
Ross: Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Ross: Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?
Ross: And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)
Ross: Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Ross: You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to… (Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?
Ross: Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)
Ross: Okay, umm…
Ross: What?
Ross: Wow! Really?!
Ross: Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!
Ross: Ohh!
Ross: Slides are almost ready.
Ross: Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.
Ross: (answering it) Hello?
Ross: O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.
Ross: So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross: Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.) Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.
Ross: (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Ross: Umm, she kissed me.
Ross: Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Ross: Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…
Ross: Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Ross: Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Ross: No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Ross: You’re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
Ross: You take care Jill.
Ross: I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
Ross: The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.
Ross: I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. (That’s karate, he’s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.
Ross: No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Ross: What?!
Ross: Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?
Ross: (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Ross: No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!
Ross: No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Ross: Yeah. Right.
Ross: Good-good, I’m-I’m married. (Shows her his ring.)
Ross: Is-isn’t it the best?
Ross: Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Ross: Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!
Ross: Come on! (They start to leave.)
Ross: No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…
Ross: (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
Ross: Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let’s go see Monica!
Ross: Hey Mon! 
Ross: Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
Ross: And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
Ross: And that’s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)
Ross: (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Ross: Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Ross: Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.
Ross: Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Well, last weekend…
Ross: …will be two months…
Ross: …since I stopped trying.
Ross: What-what do you mean?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Okay, I think I got it.
Ross: So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Ross: Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
Ross: Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…
Ross: Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Ross: Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?
Ross: Well I don’t know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carol’s shocked and obviously doesn’t like that idea.) Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesn’t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Ross: Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
Ross: I got it!
Ross: (on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she can’t come to the phone right now. (Listens.) Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
Ross: J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Ross: (To Monica) Yeah, she’s fired.
Ross: So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…
Ross: Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone’s been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
Ross: Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…
Ross: Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep.
Ross: Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
Ross: Hey, Pheebs!
Ross: Hey, how’s it going?
Ross: She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?
Ross: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Ross: We’re really gonna do this, huh?
Ross: Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
Ross: Okay.
Ross: I’m-I’m Ross by the way.
Ross: How hot is this?!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Look at you! You’re up!
Ross: Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?
Ross: No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: It was, it was okay.
Ross: Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?"
Ross: Oh-oh, absolutely!
Ross: It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Ross: Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Ross: No, she kept kicking me away!
Ross: No!
Ross: Oh I a lot of stuff!
Ross: A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Ross: Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard…
Ross: It really was!
Ross: Hey Rachel.
Ross: Umm, no.
Ross: That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Okay. (He does so.) 
Ross: We’re sorry.
Ross: Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
Ross: Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Ross: Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Ross: Men. I guy I know.
Ross: She is not… (Realizes) She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
Ross: I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
Ross: Try telling my wife that.
Ross: Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Ross: Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Ross: What’s up with the greed Joe?
Ross: Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?
Ross: Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Ross: Wow!
Ross: After one class? I don’t think so.
Ross: Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
Ross: No, it’s a concept!
Ross: All right, maybe it means that too…
Ross: Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care! 
Ross: Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Ross: (moves closer) All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams) surprise!!
Ross: All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)
Ross: Y’know what… (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)
Ross: No.
Ross: So what are you gonna do?
Ross: DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Ross: A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing every time now.)
Ross: Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Ross: I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screams…) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.) Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Ross: (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Ross: Unagi. I’m always aware.
Ross: What’s up?
Ross: Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
Ross: Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model of the Saturn V rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Ross: Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)
Ross: Why not?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
Ross: Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Ross: It’s a great class.
Ross: Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.) Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Ross: No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Ross: Yes that’s right.
Ross: I tired attacking two women, did not work.
Ross: No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Ross: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no.
Ross: Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
Ross: DANGER!!!!
Ross: Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Ross: Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.
Ross: No, but it is frowned upon.
Ross: Besides, there’s a big age difference.
Ross: I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.
Ross: (startled) Yeah?
Ross: Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
Ross: That was you?
Ross: Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.
Ross: What time?
Ross: Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Ross: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Ross: Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Ross: Umm, no. No.
Ross: Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.
Ross: Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
Ross: (pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
Ross: We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
Ross: Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Ross: Yeah. What-what should I do?
Ross: Going out with who?
Ross: Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big boobies.)
Ross: What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Ross: Oh, you have some studying to do?
Ross: Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to… (He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
Ross: Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!
Ross: What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Ross: What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Ross: That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.
Ross: What?
Ross: Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Ross: Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Ross: I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.
Ross: What?
Ross: Really?
Ross: Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong.
Ross: (feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.
Ross: Let’s also get a hot plate!
Ross: Hey everybody!
Ross: Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Ross: Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)
Ross: Bye.
Ross: Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)
Ross: Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Ross: Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!
Ross: I don’t know Rachel, why?
Ross: Well thanks!
Ross: Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Ross: Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…
Ross: Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don’t know.
Ross: Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Ross: Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don’t we go inside?
Ross: Oh-ooh!
Ross: Doorknob! Doorknob!
Ross: Oh, okay. What-what about?
Ross: Spring vacation.
Ross: (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
Ross: You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Ross: I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Ross: What the hell are you doing?
Ross: What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Ross: Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.
Ross: Do not give him any money!
Ross: Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Ross: Oo-oo!
Ross: Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Ross: Look, I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
Ross: No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…
Ross: That! Let’s talk about that.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.
Ross: What’s-what’s the difference?
Ross: Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
Ross: I went to Egypt with my dad.
Ross: Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!
Ross: I’m gonna call her.
Ross: Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know…
Ross: Okay, she can’t go.
Ross: Then what am I supposed to do?
Ross: Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Ross: I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!
Ross: Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
Ross: Are you into crafts at all?
Ross: Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
Ross: To wear in front of people?
Ross: Is this?!
Ross: So uh, have a great time down there.
Ross: Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Ross: It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Ross: Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.
Ross: Really?
Ross: Okay. Cool.
Ross: Call me!
Ross:  Excuse me?
Joey:  I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.  Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.  Joey:  C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!  Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.  Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!  Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.
Ross:  So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Ross: It’s your turn.
Ross: Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?
Ross: Totally!
Ross: Great!
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)
Ross: (stops laughing) What am I doing?
Ross: Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.
Ross: Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Ross:  Oh my God!
Ross: You ate my sandwich?
Ross: (getting upset) Oh-oh really? 
Ross: (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
Ross: You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
Ross:  (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross: MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
Ross: What?
Ross: What?
Ross: Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Ross: It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Ross: I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
Ross: I fell asleep!
Ross: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
Ross: That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when you’re dead!
Ross: There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. 
Ross: Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
Ross: Oh my God. I mean…
Ross: Totally.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: What are you guys doing later?
Ross: (continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.
Ross: Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Ross: Thanks!
Ross: It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
Ross: Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Ross: Eh-wh—Excuse me?
Ross: That’s funny. Umm…. (Pause, then serious) It’s not funny.
Ross: Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Ross: What?
Ross: This is—you—(Ross starts laughing.)
Ross: Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean, I mean I don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay, okay, a joke, a joke—lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
Ross: And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Ross: Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Ross: Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’s chair, but Paul steps in)—Yeah, why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
Ross: (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Ross: Joey?!
Ross: Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
Ross: Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here!
Ross: (coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!
Ross: What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Ross: (incredulous) In your mouth?!
Ross: You were at the coffeehouse!
Ross: He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird!
Ross: That was different!
Ross: This is weird for me!
Ross: How is that important?
Ross: Yeah, take your time. 
Ross: (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as…
Ross: Not all bad.
Ross: Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Ross: No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Ross: Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife! (Realizes) Oh, I’m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It’s unbelievable!
Ross: You’re back.
Ross: Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…
Ross: God no!
Ross: Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! (to Paul) Still not yelling!
Ross: That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.
Ross: Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so.
Ross: Ohhh! Kids!
Ross: That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Why? What?
Ross: No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Ross: Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear. 
Ross: Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and… 
Ross: Really? That okay, that’s great.
Ross: All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Ross: But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.
Ross: Ohh! A man with a plan!
Ross: This place is really beautiful!
Ross: Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?
Ross: Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Ross: No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Ross: Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.
Ross: No.
Ross: A little bit.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Ohh, okay.
Ross: What are you doing here?!
Ross: Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Ross: (under the couch) You and your ice.
Ross: (before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
Ross: Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay?
Ross: (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross: Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…
Ross: All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)
Ross: And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics Paul’s flexing.)
Ross: Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Ross: How rude.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Great to see you!
Ross: How you doing?
Ross: Okay! You take care! 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Ross: Phoebe, why’d you do it?
Ross: What?! Why?!
Ross: I can’t think of anything.
Ross: Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Ross: I guess it could.
Ross: Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Ross: Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Ross: Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Ross: Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Ross: Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Ross: Oh. (Starts to get his money) 
Ross: All the time?
Ross: Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
Ross: What?!
Ross: I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
Ross: Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!
Ross: That’s right!
Ross: Eh? We’ll show him!
Ross: Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Ross: So you two are really serious?!
Ross: You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! (They hug.)
Ross: Hey-hey Pheebs!
Ross: Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Ross: You told her before you told us?
Ross: God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Ross: Yeah, you didn’t get one.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Ross: I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!
Ross: I don’t know.
Ross: Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Ross: Uh-uh—Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Ross: Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Ross: (to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Ross: What’s-what’s going on?
Ross: Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building!
Ross: Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same…
Ross: No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Ross: Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh…
Ross: (screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
Ross: Oh my God, you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)
Ross: Who?
Ross: What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.
Ross: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Ross: Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.
Ross: Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.
Ross: Hmm.
Ross: Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…
Ross: No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.
Ross: I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Ross: (in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross: Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…
Ross: What?!
Ross: Okay, break-up’s still on!
Ross: What happened you guys?
Ross: Rach!
Ross: Hey, come on in.
Ross: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
Ross: I guess so.
Ross: Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Ross: Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Ross: Phoebe.
Ross: Ohh, I don’t think so.
Ross: That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
Ross: I was not!
Ross: No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
Ross: Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Ross: All right.
Ross: Hey, what’s going on?
Ross: I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Ross: What’s up?
Ross: Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.
Ross: Where is she?
Ross: Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I’m gay! I’m gay!" Can I bring her in?
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Wow! Happy Monica’s night!
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: Well sure. But I get married all the time so…
Ross: You okay?
Ross: You mean, we—you and me?
Ross: Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Ross: I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.
Ross: Surely you can think of something good.
Ross: What?
Ross: Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Ross: My hands?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: (to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Ross: A what?
Ross: One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Ross: No.
Ross: Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really, really…don’t.
Ross: Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…
Ross: It is! It is!
Ross: Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
Ross: Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!
Ross: Oh no!
Ross: And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
Ross: Guess who? (Enters fully.)
Ross: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…
Ross: Still thinking about it huh?
Ross: (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?
Ross: (tightening his tie) And so do I.
Ross: Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
Ross: (sitting up) No! (Exits.)
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, here’s a thought.
Ross: Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
Ross: Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.
Ross: Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…
Ross: Oh, I see, so everybody wins. 
Ross: Oww!
Ross: (deadpan) Well, I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.
Ross: (at the door) And uh, Rachel.
Ross: What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.) 
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh, I’ll have some!
Ross: Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Ross: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!
Ross: And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at… (Phoebe rushes in.)
Ross: Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Ross: Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what’s going on?
Ross: Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Ross: Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Ross: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Ross: Uh, Phoebe…
Ross: Phoebe, what are you doing?
Ross: Phoebe!
Ross: Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!
Ross: And they knew about it?
Ross: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Ross: The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.
Ross: Hello.
Ross: Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.
Ross: Can I, can I help you with something?
Ross: (deadpan) Yes I am.
Ross: Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh, that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)
Ross: (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Ross: (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
Ross: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Ross: (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?
Ross: (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?
Ross: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Ross: Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Ross: Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.
Ross: He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.
Ross: His daughter was hot.
Ross: About what?
Ross: Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.
Ross: Are you sure?
Ross: (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Ross: No, why?
Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Ross: Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Ross: Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: You’re not a lefty? 
Ross: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Ross: No one got me an engagement present.
Ross: Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
Ross: (entering with Chandler) Hey.
Ross: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…
Ross: And what did he ask you not to call him?
Ross: Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
Ross: ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
Ross: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Ross: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Ross: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Ross: You were trying to eat it!
Ross: Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.
Ross: You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
Ross: Let’s give it a shot.
Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.
Ross: Which one was that?
Ross: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) I’m okay.
Ross: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
Ross: Looking up?
Ross: Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Ross: That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.
Ross: Ohhhh…
Ross: It wasn’t the best.
Ross: Well, the lighting was okay.
Ross: Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!"
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.
Ross: (notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
Ross: What you got over there? Tacos?
Ross: Uhh, those are tacos.
Ross: Eh, either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What’s so funny?!
Ross: (To Chandler) You told her!
Ross: (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Ross: (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
Ross: Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Ross: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…
Ross: And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
Ross: Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…
Ross: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Ross: All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross: Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Ross: Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.
Ross: Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
Ross: Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Ross: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Ross: And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Ross: And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Ross: Okay, (gets up) if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
Ross: Man! (Monica mouths, "I’m sorry.")
Ross: (To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh…
Ross: Amazing!
Ross: Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Ross: It’s not a club.
Ross: Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Ross: Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Ross: Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.
Ross: I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Ross: I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, "I love you and that’s why I have to kill you."
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: What?! No!
Ross: Look, I don’t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)
Ross: All right! I want my key back!
Ross: It’s right there! (Points to her hand.)
Ross: Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Ross: Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.
Ross: Hi Whitney.
Ross: Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
Ross: (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I’m sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Ross: Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Ross: Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!
Ross: Like what?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."
Ross: Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Ross: I think he can be.
Ross: Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Ross: (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Ross: So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.) I’m sorry you had to see that.
Ross: My God!
Ross: Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Ross: Wh-what’s up?
Ross: Oh just say it Kyle!
Ross: (To Whitney) Y’know, he hums when he pees!
Ross: It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Ross: That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.
Ross: (To Phoebe) I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Ross: Yeah, were better off without them.
Ross: Divorced men’s club.
Ross: Joey, we just saw it!
Ross: And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Joey and Ross:
Ross: Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Ross: Well, John McLane had plans!
Ross: What happened?!!
Ross: We fell asleep! That is all.
Ross: I think that would be best.
Ross: Okay. But not about this!
Ross: No touch! No touch!
Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. 
Ross: Just uh, brought back your videos.
Ross: No! No we don’t!
Ross: I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
Ross: I’ve had better.
Ross: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Ross: I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
Ross: We can’t do it again.
Ross: Because it’s weird!
Ross: Sure, what do you got?
Ross: No, 10 is the highest.
Ross: Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)
Ross: Yes, very nice Rachel.
Ross: (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Ross: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Ross: Go!
Ross: Yeah, it really was!
Ross: Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really don’t see the point.
Ross: I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Ross: Actually, it wasn’t that close.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Why-why would I care about that?
Ross: It really was.
Ross: (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
Ross: Okay, okay take a guess.
Ross: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)
Ross: (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?
Ross: People are doing it in front of my book!
Ross: My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Ross: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!
Ross: Oh for cryin’ out loud! (He storms out.)
Ross: Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)
Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!
Ross: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Ross: Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Ross: Ah… Ah…Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?
Ross: I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
Ross: I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller.
Ross: Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
Ross: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Ross: I am very…very sorry.
Ross: (to the guard) Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay, see you later. 
Ross: (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! 
Ross: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? 
Ross: What? That's like insanely easy! 
Ross: What? You forgot fourteen states? 
Ross: Wow, how many have you got? 
Ross: Done! With time a-to-spare. 
Ross: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? 
Ross: What? That's impossible. 
Ross: No, just give me another minute. 
Ross: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner. 
Ross: You're on! 
Ross: Pshhshhh!
Ross: Phoebe, why is your bag moving? 
Ross: Ohio!! Thank you! 
Ross: What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
Ross: Are you out of your mind?
Ross: Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Ross: It's too cold. 
Ross: (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
Ross: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s. 
Ross: Damn, I forgot you were here. 
Ross: Hey! What's she doing back here? 
Ross: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... 
Ross: Yeah, but, but look what I'm... 
Ross: Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. 
Ross: Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
Ross: No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. 
Ross: Because you sent away the dog!
Ross: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. 
Ross: From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please! 
Ross: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. 
Ross: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something. 
Ross: Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? 
Ross: Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.) 
Ross: Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
Ross: (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now! 
Ross: (pauses) I know. 
Ross: You sure?
Ross: No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours. (Ross pushes him off.)
Ross: Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (shocked) What?!
Ross: Ohh.
Ross: That is so unfair!
Ross: Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! (Monica runs to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Ross: Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so… 
Ross: You like it?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Ahh.
Ross: Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride.
Ross: (stunned at the complement) You’re welcome.
Ross: Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Ross: Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Ross: Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?
Ross: Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…
Ross: Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Ross: Well…In-in case of emergency.
Ross: Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."
Ross: Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Ross: No!
Ross: I swear!
Ross: Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They start.) 
Ross: All right. Feel good?
Ross: All right, try pedaling. 
Ross: That’s it, your doing great.
Ross: Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Ross: Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
Ross: I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…
Ross: It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
Ross: Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.
Ross: Need some help?
Ross: By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)
Ross: (entering) Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
Ross: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Ross: Phoebe.
Ross: All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.
Ross: Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
Ross: Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike very happy.
Ross: Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: (Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Ross: Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Ross: Hmm.
Ross: Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
Ross: Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Ross: Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Ross: Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesn’t.) Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Ross: Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Ross: (interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh (Sings) Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Ross: (interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest.
Ross: Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Ross: No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Ross: No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Ross: (disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: No, these are my pants.
Ross: Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Ross: Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.
Ross: I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!
Ross: (to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Ross: That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Ross: You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Ross: (gasps) You are? Me, too!
Ross: (to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ross: What are you doing here, Santa?
Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Ross: (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Ross: Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Ross: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.
Ross: I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Ross: Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Ross: Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Ross: All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Ross: …and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…
Ross: That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben, and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
Ross: Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
Ross: Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Ross: Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Ross: Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.
Ross: No.
Ross: Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Ross: Y’know, she tried to undress me too.
Ross: Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica shakes her head in disgust.)
Ross: Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.
Ross: Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Ross: So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.
Ross: Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. 
Ross: Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.
Ross: Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Ross: (interrupting) Not broad backed!
Ross: What? I can’t cancel on Joan!
Ross: Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Ross: Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. (Does so.)
Ross: Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.
Ross: (To Monica) Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Ross: Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Ross: Yes, yes it is. It’s uh… (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Ross: Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.
Ross: That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on Frannie’s shoulder.)
Ross: (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Ross: So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Ross: What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)
Ross: Well…
Ross: Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica’s wrap and walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)
Ross: Well, technically it seven billion years ago… (Well, technically you’d be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)
Ross: Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don’t streak across the sky, meteors do.) Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King.
Ross: Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from the city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?
Ross: Huh?
Ross: What?
Ross: What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey’s standing.)
Ross: Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Ross: Show me where?
Ross: (noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?
Ross: Joey!
Ross: It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.) Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! 
Ross: Rachel!! Monica!!
Ross: I can’t believe this!!
Ross: (standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don’t have a choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!
Ross: (To Joey) I know, I wasn’t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.) (Yelling at the street) But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!
Ross: Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Ross: Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
Ross: Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.
Ross: Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
Ross: Okay. Well, you be careful.
Ross: Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
Ross: (looking in the window behind them) Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
Ross: I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big, large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)
Ross: Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Ross: Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now.
Ross: Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
Ross: I would say that.
Ross: Okay, here I go.
Ross: I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
Ross: So what do you want me to do?
Ross: Hi.
Ross: (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Ross: It’s still looks pretty far!
Ross: Do not rush me!!
Ross: Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I—Ooh, a quarter!
Ross: Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That’s weird isn’t it?
Ross: (disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!
Ross: I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
Ross: (on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes we’re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?
Ross: I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.
Ross: They kept your room for a while.
Ross: Come on, you know they love you.
Ross: I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: What’s wrong with this year?
Ross: Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Ross: What?
Ross: Dad?
Ross: (entering with Monica) Hey!
Ross: Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.
Ross: (To Monica) Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Ross: Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Ross: Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?
Ross: Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades) Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym…(He puts it away and finds something else.) Oooh, my rock polisher!
Ross: It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!
Ross: What?
Ross: How are you ever going to sell this place?
Ross: Oh no. Dad! Dad! What…(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.) Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!
Ross: No!
Ross: Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Ross: Well, can you blame her?
Ross: Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.
Ross: Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their. 
Ross: Like uh y’know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could’ve made this!
Ross: Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could’ve won this!
Ross: Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Ross: Hey.
Ross: (overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great memory.
Ross: Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Ross: Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
Ross: Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.
Ross: Umm, your boxes are umm…
Ross: Dad?
Ross: All right. I think it was a mouse.
Ross: (even more shocked) What?!!!
Ross: Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Ross: Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!
Ross: Happy birthday!!!
Ross: We’ve got presents!
Ross: Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Ross: Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Ross: Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Ross: How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Ross: That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Ross: (giddy) I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!
Ross: Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. 
Ross: Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
Ross: Okay, forward. Forward—Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Okay, back—Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the front.) Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross: No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. (The woman walks away.)
Ross: Maybe that will liven up this party.
Ross: (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Ross: Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?
Ross: What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)
Ross: Which is fine! Because you just turned—(Removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!
Ross: (To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
Ross: I really wish that you wouldn’t.
Ross: Come on!
Ross: Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Ross: (interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!
Ross: All right everyone, lift! (They and try to lift the car, of course it doesn’t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)
Ross: God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?
Ross: Yes! My baby’s finally free! 
Ross: (starting it) Woohoo!
Ross: You wanna buy a car?
Ross: What’s the matter? You okay?
Ross: Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Ross: Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Ross: Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Ross: What? A brain transplant?!
Ross: It’s ridiculous!
Ross: (to Monica and Rachel) It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
Ross: Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Ross: What?!
Ross: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Ross: Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
Ross: How did you know about that?!
Ross: Were you the ones called the cops?!
Ross: Why not?
Ross: Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
Ross: No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.
Ross: …now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Ross: (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Ross: (stands up) Now umm, remember I’m still learning.
Ross: One, two, three, four!
Ross: You know the song! Sing along!
Ross: So?
Ross: You know the song! Sing along!
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Ross: Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?
Ross: (to Ben) Okay! All clear!
Ross: (to Ben) Everything okay in there?
Ross: Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Ross: Oh, she isn’t home.
Ross: Well, Ben would be there.
Ross: What’s the matter?
Ross: Rach, he’s not an ex-con.
Ross: I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Ross: Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Ross: (To Rachel) I wasn’t talking to you.
Ross: Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in an hour.
Ross: I have a bone to pick with you.
Ross: Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Ross: That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Ross: Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
Ross: I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Ross: Rachel! What are you doing here?
Ross: Your good friend?
Ross: What’s her last name?
Ross: Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Ross: Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) "Dude, don’t you ever was your face?"
Ross: Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Practical jokes.
Ross: You have a line down your face.
Ross: Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
Ross: I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Ross: No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…
Ross: Okay, I’ll see you later pal.
Ross: What?
Ross: What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great. That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Ross: All right, that’s it! (He runs over to Ben, but he runs past him and out the door.) Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!
Ross: Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
Ross: I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)
Ross: (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Ross: Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
Ross: (exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (Calmly) So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly waves.)
Ross: Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.
Ross: Ah.
Ross: Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.)
Ross: Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he’s holding.)
Ross: Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When she’s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can’t pick it up.)
Ross: Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.
Ross: Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
Ross: (returning) Hey.
Ross: Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
Ross: Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Joey and Ross:
Ross: Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Ross: Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her…
Ross: That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…
Ross: Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Ross: No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.
Ross: Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…
Ross: Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.
Ross: So let’s decide on the spending limit…
Ross: I was thinking more like a hundred.
Ross: Hey! What’s up?
Ross: Oh thanks!
Ross: We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Ross: I am dressed.
Ross: I have an oily T-zone!
Ross: That’s right.
Ross: Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Ross: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Ross: Why am I not surprised?
Ross: I don’t think you have much choice.
Ross: Bye-bye!
Ross: Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).
Ross: So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Ross: Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.
Ross: Yeah. So…
Ross: So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Ross: That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?
Ross: Much better.
Ross: Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.
Ross: That’s right! Wait no, Ben.
Ross: Well umm…
Ross: Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Joey and Ross:
Ross: Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Ross: Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Ross: Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Ross: Probably around gonorrhea.
Ross: Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!
Ross: …and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis? 
Ross: Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Ross: Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn’t know what to make of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all for today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? 
Ross: Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.
Ross: Well you need 60% to pass…
Ross: Seven.
Ross: No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?
Ross: Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem.
Ross: Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Ross: Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’m sorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Ross: Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Ross: There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
Ross: I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Ross: Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (Rachel and Joey both look at him.)
Ross: It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Ross: Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Ross: (turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Ross: And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
Ross: (turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
Ross: No!
Ross: Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
Ross: What?
Ross: I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
Ross: Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Ross: Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.
Ross: ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.
Ross: Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay—(Ned looks shocked)—Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I’ll be right with you. (To Ned) Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)
Ross: A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Ross: Cassie?
Ross: Wow, I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Ross: So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
Ross: What—why?
Ross: What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
Ross: Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Ross: (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.
Ross: It’s okay. Come, come on in.
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Ross: Yeah—No!!
Ross: Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
Ross: (quietly) Thank God.
Ross: Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now.
Ross: (looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
Ross: Well I’m, I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children would be.
Ross: (in his head) She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (She grabs some popcorn.) Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in. 
Ross: (in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause) There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To her) I-I, I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his head) Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.
Ross: She seems really, really fun!
Ross: What?!
Ross: So that’s two of my wives.
Ross: Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
Ross: No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!
Ross: That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.
Ross: So?
Ross: Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Ross: Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Ross: When I got married you slept with my sister.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. 
Ross: Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Ross: Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Ross: What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!
Ross: Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.
Ross: What?
Ross: Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
Ross: Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Ross: Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Ross: ...everyone, this is Chandler!
Ross: 
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Ross: How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
Ross: I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!
Ross: Phoebe that’s not true.
Ross: Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Ross: (entering) What's going on?
Ross: What?! What?!
Ross: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Ross: (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ross: It’ll be okay Joe.
Ross: That little naked guy would be me.
Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Ross: Got me.
Ross: Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
Ross: (looking) Nono, that would be me again.
Ross: (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.
Ross: (quietly) Dude!
Ross: Dude! How-how did you write this?
Ross: You can’t do that!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Ross: It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Ross: Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Ross: Only way to fly.
Ross: You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Ross: Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Ross: What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
Ross: No way!
Ross: Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. 
Ross: What do you think you’re doing?!
Ross: There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?
Ross: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)
Ross: With you?! Yeah right!
Ross: (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)
Ross: In the death seat?!!
Ross: (shocked) You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Ross: (grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Ross: Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Ross: I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
Ross: Yeah, I’ll get right on that.
Ross: No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.
Ross: Oh my God.
Ross: Dear Lord!!
Ross: Here it comes.
Ross: Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Ross: I can handle the stick!!
Ross: Who?
Ross: What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
Ross: Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! (They pull over.)
Ross: Good evening officer.
Ross: Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty.
Ross: I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
Ross: Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
Ross: (laughs) You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?
Ross: I know. I know.
Ross: Oh, where are you guys going?
Ross: Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?
Ross: (To Chandler) Y’know what? Actually I’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
Ross: Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Ross: No, its…Its not that. Umm, now what I’m going to say to you, I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as Monica’s older brother.
Ross: Not for the next few minutes.
Ross: Nope.
Ross: Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica’s older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What? I’m-I’m-I’m serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) Come—Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I’m-I’m not kidding here!
Ross: No problem.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (walks up) Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
Ross: Well I…I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)
Ross: Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)
Ross: (clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyone’s attention please? I’m uh; I’m Ross Geller.
Ross: Dad…dad, please! As I was saying umm, I’m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I’m the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she’s the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you’d all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we’re here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.
Ross: Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Ross: What? Are you going back to work?
Ross: Nice shades.
Ross: And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Ross: Hey, where’s Chandler?
Ross: (going up to Rachel’s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and looks inside and doesn’t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still doesn’t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)
Ross: Hey! 
Ross: Is uh, is Monica here?
Ross: I think Chandler’s gone. (He hands her the note.)
Ross: He left that.
Ross: I think it means he freaked out and left!
Ross: Look—Okay, I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Ross: (scared) I will, I will find him.
Ross: Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Ross: Oh damn!
Ross: Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh, we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Ross: Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks away slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (They’re sitting by the window.) What-what…what you guys doing here?!
Ross: Why?!
Ross: (shocked) Gunther?!
Ross: What? Your-your list?
Ross: Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I’m looking for him?
Ross: No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!
Ross: No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I’m interested in them.
Ross: No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!
Ross: Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Ross: Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Ross: Give me two.
Ross: Okay, wish me luck.
Ross: Why?!
Ross: We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!
Ross: That is an old, Chinese woman!
Ross: Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?
Ross: So this is your office?
Ross: She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.
Ross: What’s wrong with being the Bings?
Ross: Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Ross: Then you are neither of your parents!
Ross: Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Ross: (interrupting him) Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?
Ross: There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary, was it?
Ross: I’m telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Ross: Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you’ve done everything else!
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
Ross: He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.
Ross: (pause) You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Ross: Oh my God! Monica!
Ross: Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: These-these are beads of joy.
Ross: Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Ross: Chandler’s gone again!
Ross: (turning a corner) There he is!!
Ross: You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Ross: Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) I’m serious! You’re not walking out on my sister!
Ross: Then where the hell have you been?!
Ross: What?
Ross: What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Ross: Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…
Ross: Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?
Phoebe and Ross:
Ross: Dude. (Hugs him.)
Ross: Huh. This is nice.
Ross: I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in divorce.
Ross: Rings?
Ross: Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn’t. I did.
Ross: Mornin’
Ross: I think, subconsciously…
Ross: (jumping up) No! No! No!
Ross: Hi! We’re visiting!
Ross: It’s Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y’know, you might as well say it because I told your…
Ross: Can you say Da-Da? See, I’m gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try…
Ross: Huh?
Ross: Nothing.
Ross: That tastes like feet!
Ross: That tastes like feet!
Ross: Excuse me, what?
Ross: Pivot! (They pivot) Pivot! (They pivot) Okay, pivot! Piv-at! (He starts laughing.)
Ross: Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!
Ross: (To Chandler) All right! All right! All right! (To Joey) We are fixing it. 
Ross: Oh the band’s ready! And well—I-I—we gotta do what the band says, right? I don’t care about the stinkin’ band!!
Ross: No-no! I’ll-I’ll… (He takes too much and some falls out of his mouth, which starts him laughing.)
Ross: (To Monica) Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And I’m so excited for you!
Ross: Monica’s pregnant!
Ross: What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?
Ross: No! (Pause) I’ll be right back. (Exits.)
Ross: Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.
Ross: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
Ross: Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
Ross: Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
Ross: Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.
Ross: (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken.
Ross: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.
Ross: It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.
Ross: Umm, would you like to dance?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
Ross: I wasn’t farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?
Ross: Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady. 
Ross: Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.
Ross: Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
Ross: Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?
Ross: Keep dancing.
Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.
Ross: All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
Ross: Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
Ross: What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Ross: I am so gonna score.
Ross: I like your bow.
Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.) 
Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what’s uh, what’s your name.
Ross: That’s, that’s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross’s feet, but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
Ross: I’m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert’s shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)
Ross: I just didn’t see the fast song coming.
Ross: Oh, thank you.
Ross: Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.
Ross: Thread!
Ross: What disposable cameras?
Ross: No you didn’t.
Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.
Ross: No. Sorry man.
Ross: Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.
Ross: In-in three minutes.
Ross: Chandler?
Ross: No. Did you?
Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.
Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
Ross: I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Ross: No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.
Ross: I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Ross: I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?
Ross: What about the chairs?
Ross: How about the place settings?
Ross: What did you do?
Ross: Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)
Ross: I heard it. I heard it.
Ross: Okay. Okay! 
Ross: Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
Ross: A ’95 LeSabre?!
Ross: A green LeSabre?
Ross: I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
Ross: Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Now you are going to love these.
Ross: Huh, didn’t see that coming.
Ross: Well, I’m gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.
Ross: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!
Ross: Hey! How you doing?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Oh hey, right back at ya.
Ross: Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady?
Ross: (shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Ross: He is so weird.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: No why?
Ross: Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
Ross: Oh no.
Ross: I think I might know what this is about.
Ross: Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
Ross: Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Ross: Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?
Ross: I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?
Ross: Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: (quietly confident) I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? (They go inside.) Look uh, I know why you’re here.
Ross: Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Ross: Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
Ross: I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
Ross: Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Ross: Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
Ross: I’m good. I’m good.
Ross: Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
Ross: What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Ross: No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Ross: Oh well I may as well have!
Ross: Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
Ross: No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, (picks up the phone) I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Ross: (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
Ross: (on phone) Yeah I’ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to escape.)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Sure.
Ross: Namaste. (Bows.)
Ross: Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Ross: Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Ross: Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant.
Ross: With my child.
Ross: You already know don’t you?
Ross: Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.
Ross: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Ross: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
Ross: I gotta go find her.
Ross: Evidently they do.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Uh we-we need to talk.
Ross: Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Ross: What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards Rachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…
Ross: Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
Ross: Well yeah, I think we should get married.
Ross: No, because that’s the right thing to do.
Ross: No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.
Ross: Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.
Ross: I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
Ross: When have you ever?
Ross: Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Ross: I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!
Ross: But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Ross: (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.
Ross: Oh my God.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Pretty amazing huh?
Ross: What? What?!
Ross: You-you just said that you did!
Ross: Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, (rolls the machine closer) it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there (Points).
Ross: Do you really?
Ross: Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Ross: Sweetie that’s it.
Ross: You’re welcome.
Ross: Yeah, that’s our baby.
Ross: Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Ross: Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Ross: Hello!
Ross: So, how was the honeymoon?
Ross: (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
Ross: (laughs) Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
Ross: The lie you just told.
Ross: There’s the one!
Ross: Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.
Ross: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Ross: Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
Ross: I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It’s an expression.
Ross: (entering) Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!
Ross: Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
Ross: Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. 
Ross: About…about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn’t had sex in months?
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about.
Ross: I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Ross: Five to be lying, six.
Ross: Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
Ross: Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!
Ross: Really? Well then tell it to me.
Ross: (sarcastic) I’ll try to control myself.
Ross: (laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Ross: (stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
Ross: (intently listening) Why?
Ross: It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Ross: Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
Ross: Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…
Ross: (whines) Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…
Ross: Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Ross: Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Ross: No! No, I don’t…don’t want to.
Ross: I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Ross: I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…
Ross: It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
Ross: I’ll try that.
Ross: Thanks.
Ross: Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Ross: Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
Ross: Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
Ross: (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Ross: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Ross: Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "You’ll show me right?") No!
Ross: Joey! No!
Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)
Ross: Forget it, she’s destroying it.
Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Ross: What?!
Ross: I don’t want people to see it for your sake.
Ross: Rachel, please…
Ross: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)
Ross: (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
Ross: (on tape) You didn’t do it?
Ross: (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
Ross: (on tape) I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost…
Ross: (on tape) I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.
Ross: (on tape) So we…we both wanted to.
Ross: (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Ross: And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
Ross: Now I’m so happy.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.
Ross: It was. It was an amazing night.
Ross: I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.
Ross: Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
Ross: Good luck.
Ross: Mind if I mute?
Ross: Oh, oh there go the clothes.
Ross: Six months Rachel, six months.
Ross: Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.
Ross: Oh nice tan!
Ross: Ah….
Ross: I have been working out.
Ross: Oh that’s not pretty.
Ross: No!
Ross: Oh no!
Ross: Oh no!!
Ross: No!!
Ross: No!!!
Ross: (running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Ross: Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Yeah!!
Ross: I’m telling you, I like the food!
Ross: Did that guy just call you Toby?
Ross: Well, why don’t you correct him?
Ross: Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Ross: (laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
Ross: Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
Ross: (entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
Ross: So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Ross: Rach? You wanna come?
Ross: A date?
Ross: Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.
Ross: A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
Ross: You set her up?!
Ross: Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Ross: Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?
Ross: A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Ross: Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!
Ross: Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.
Ross: A bit of a daredevil are we?
Ross: Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Ross: Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)
Ross: Books?
Ross: Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.
Ross: Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.
Ross: I just…I have to find out how it went.
Ross: This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
Ross: I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
Ross: I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
Ross: It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.
Ross: No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Ross: It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
Ross: No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
Ross: No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Ross: Hello.
Ross: Well, how was the date?
Ross: Uh-huh. What happened?
Ross: Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?
Ross: Oh?
Ross: He sounds swell.
Ross: Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?
Ross: Sit down. 
Ross: Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Ross: Yeah-ha!
Ross: I’m sorry about your date.
Ross: Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
Ross: You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Ross: Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Ross: Right. Good night.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh hi!
Ross: Wow! Uh…how are you?
Ross: Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Ross: Great! Well umm…
Ross: Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
Ross: What?
Ross: Well, I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…
Ross: (exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: That’s right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. (To Joey) Please don’t take her from me.
Ross: (entering) Hey! (He’s wearing a costume as well.)
Ross: Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well, I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes… (They’re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!
Ross: No, I-I’m not doody.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: You made it!
Ross: Well, I’m a spud…
Ross: Yes!
Ross: That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Ross: Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Ross: Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!! 
Ross: Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
Ross: Pride.
Ross: (To Chandler) So, you gettin’ tired?
Ross: Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin’ a little tired though.
Ross: Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona’s standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
Ross: Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.
Ross: Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.
Ross: (celebrating) Oh yeah!
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)
Ross: I think it’s coming from your bag.
Ross: So apparently I’m available for lunch.
Ross: You’re moving?
Ross: So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
Ross: That’s not really porn.
Ross: Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Ross: Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yeah. No. No you’re right. 
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
Ross: I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh, thank God!
Ross: Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
Ross: Y’know I would it’s just painful.
Ross: Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates that phrase into Dutch.)
Ross: Yeah, we’re done.
Ross: Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
Ross: Really?!
Ross: Sweet!
Ross: Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Ross: No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Ross: It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.
Ross: Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.
Ross: Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Ross: (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!
Ross: Damnit!
Ross: Hi. How is she?
Ross: (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
Ross: Oh I don’t know that it would.
Ross: All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
Ross: Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!
Ross: (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
Ross: Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Ross: Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
Ross: Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight.
Ross: Okay, bye. 
Ross: Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great. She’s, she’s so…
Ross: Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
Ross: Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off, y’know?
Ross: Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his agreement.)
Ross: Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.
Ross: Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Ross: So much more.
Ross: Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One. (There’s an angry knock on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)
Ross: Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
Ross: Who did?!
Ross: Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Ross: No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.
Ross: (to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Ross: (to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
Ross: (To Mona) But I didn’t want to.
Ross: I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
Ross: I was going to tell you, but…
Ross: Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The phone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he’s trapped behind the apothecary table by Dr. Green.) Can I just… (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don’t we just let the machine get that?
Ross: No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.
Ross: So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!
Ross: I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!
Ross: Rachel!
Ross: Okay!
Ross: Thank you!
Ross: Thank you so much for coming back over.
Ross: Focus.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Trying to date this woman.
Ross: Probably shouldn’t touch me.
Ross: Should I leave this open for you too?
Ross: Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Ross: I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!
Ross: (entering) Will!
Ross: Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?
Ross: Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
Ross: Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Ross: Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’ graduation party.
Ross: Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (laughs) Yeah.
Ross: So how long are you in town?
Ross: Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Ross: Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
Will: Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
Ross: No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
Ross: No. No.
Ross: Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.
Ross: That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.
Ross: Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined…
Ross: …co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Ross: No-no! No-no. No-no.
Ross: It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
Ross: Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.
Ross: Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.
Ross: Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!
Ross: Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
Ross: What?
Ross: (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
Ross: No.
Ross: Hey! She didn’t look 50!
Ross: She didn’t photograph well!
Ross: I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…
Ross: Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the club!
Ross: As a romancer of the elderly.
Ross: The eyes…did still sparkle.
Ross: Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Nope.
Ross: That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.
Ross: Bye.
Ross: Yeah. Why?
Ross: Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.
Ross: Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
Ross: What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Ross: Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.
Ross: Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…
Ross: I dropped him off at Carol’s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.
Ross: Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
Ross: Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.
Ross: Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.
Ross: Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
Ross: Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.
Ross: What?
Ross: Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…
Ross: Phoebe, I…
Ross: You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)
Ross: Well…let’s just say… (singing) Rosss caaaaan!
Ross: Uh, middle balcony.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hi!
Ross: Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Ross: Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Ross: Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Ross: (pause) Together? Like-like to people?
Ross: Okay. (Not happy about it.)
Ross: Uh sure, sure.
Ross: I know. Can you believe that?
Ross: Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Huh. Wow, this is great.
Ross: Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
Ross: A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Ross: Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Huh.
Ross: Hmm…
Ross: Let’s do the card!
Ross: The card! I think we’re there!
Ross: Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!
Ross: Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
Ross: I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Ross: Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.
Ross: Smaller than that.
Ross: Uh, bigger than that.
Ross: Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Ross: Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
Ross: Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
Ross: Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
Ross: Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there isn’t.)
Ross: I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?
Ross: Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.
Ross: But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment. (Hands her his key.)
Ross: Really.
Ross: Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
Ross: Oh great, I live on the street.
Ross: Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
Ross: No. That guy is.
Ross: I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Ross: I love you!
Ross: Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
Ross: Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so….
Ross: No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn’t I get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)
Ross: …which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance. (The bell rings.) Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Ross: What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Ross: Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!
Ross: Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I’m sorry I’m a little late. Ah—(Checks his watch)—Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up, I’m Professor Geller. Good job today.
Ross: No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Ross: Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
Ross: Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.
Ross: You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Ross: Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)
Ross: Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay, why don’t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where… (Exhales again) Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay, (Closes his book.) umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—(Passes out and collapses.)
Ross: Phoebe!!
Ross: So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time, he’s wearing in-line skates and hasn’t taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs…

Ross: (crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
Ross: Hey!
Ross: What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel’s belly.)
Ross: Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Ross: My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.
Ross: Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Ross: (rushes in) Is everything okay?
Ross: Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Ross: Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.
Ross: Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
Ross: No I—Mona!
Ross: What? Why? What’s wrong?
Ross: No really, you tell me what’s up.
Ross: (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Ross: Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.
Ross: Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Ross: Well yeah!
Ross: What?! What?! Rach what?!
Ross: I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Ross: (to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?
Ross: I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!
Ross: Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
Ross: So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
Ross: No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Ross: Really?
Ross: Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)

Ross: Um, you…you like Rachel?
Ross: Rachel?!
Ross: But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 
Ross: It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?
Ross: Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
Ross: Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: (stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?! 
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!
Ross: Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
Ross: Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.
Ross: He’s not?
Ross: Why?
Ross: Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?
Ross: Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: No, I don’t want to hit you.
Ross: No.
Ross: No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
Ross: Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: What?! You’re in love with her.
Ross: Umm, no.
Ross: I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Ross: No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
Ross: If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
Ross: Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
Ross: So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
Ross: I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.
Ross: Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)
Ross: (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
Ross: Faded salmon color.
Ross: Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
Ross: That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Ross: I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)
Ross: Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
Ross: Hello!!
Ross: Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Ross: (on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There’s a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in. (She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s just that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)
Ross: You do?
Ross: (faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right.
Ross: (laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
Ross: Sure. Yeah.
Ross: Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Ross: Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Aww that is so cool.
Ross: (picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Ross: You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Ross: Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.
Ross: Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
Ross: So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Ross: Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Ross: Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
Ross: That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…
Ross: Wha—What?
Ross: Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?
Ross: Can you believe that?
Ross: No, us having to lie about being married.
Ross: Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Ross: We love marriage!
Ross: Hey
Ross: I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?
Ross: (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
Ross: That depends, how much did you hear?
Ross: What was wrong with Mona?
Ross: Yeah baby!
Ross: No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
Ross: Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side) Umm…. what are you doing?
Ross: Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley. 
Ross: Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…
Ross: Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
Ross: Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.
Ross: No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Ross: …and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Ross: But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?
Ross: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: I know, I know it was stupid. 
Ross: No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. 
Ross: It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night
Ross: Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up? 
Ross: That’s all I’m askin’ 
Ross: Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech. 
Ross: Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was. 
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Why’d you say no?
Ross: Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
Ross: Shhh! We’re not talking.
Ross: Uh, double latte, extra foam.
Ross:
Ross:
Ross:
Ross: Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Ross: It tastes like feet!
Ross:
Ross: (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
Ross: Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Ross: Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Ross: Yeah, you too.
Ross: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).
Ross:
Ross: Your make-up!
Ross: Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
Ross: I would say that.
Ross: Okay, here I go.
Ross: I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
Ross: It really was.
Ross: Hi Jill.
Ross: Amazing! Amazing!
Ross: Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Ross: Did you just wink at me?
Ross: Oh cool!
Ross: Well do you want some help?
Ross: Awesome!
Ross: (simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
Ross: Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh…
Ross: I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Ross: The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question. 
Ross: It’s okay, I’m ready.
Ross: (exhaling) The fear of Triscuts! 
Ross: It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.
Ross: Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
Ross: Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
Ross: What?!
Ross: (To Chandler) You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…
Ross: (excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler) Haaa! (To Joey) I’d like a Wicked Wango card!
Ross: (thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Ross: Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Ross: I’d like to spin the wheel!
Ross: Is there a hopping bonus?
Ross: Ben Franklin.
Ross: Queen Victoria.
Ross: Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Ross: Yeah!!
Ross: (entering, out of breath) Hey!
Ross: I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Ross: Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Ross: (excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Ross: Uh, what?
Ross: What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.
Ross: Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
Ross: Well we…we don’t have a garage.
Ross: Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Ross: I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
Ross: Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Ross: Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.
Ross: Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
Ross: Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn’t believe that.) Hey! You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?
Ross: Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother. 
Ross: I’m telling you.
Ross: Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
Ross: You sure?
Ross: All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer’s voice) Rachel Green! Let’s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
Ross: Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Ross: That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
Ross: Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
Ross: Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I’ve lost sight of why we’re doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)
Ross: Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the table.)
Ross: No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didn’t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)
Ross: Umm…
Ross: But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Ross: Yeah, they all know.
Ross: (startling him) What?! What?
Ross: Are ya?
Ross: What are you doing up?
Ross: Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…
Ross: It’s funny you should mention diapers.
Ross: Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Ross: (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you’re gonna do this, then I’m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So… (Starts for the bathroom.)
Ross: (annoyed) Yeah!
Ross: (stunned) (thinks) Well uh…
Ross: Oh.
Ross: We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved. (The cashier, a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please.
Ross: Oh, okay.
Ross: I chose those, I’m a paleontologist.
Ross: Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Ross: That’s my gym.
Ross: I am like Indiana Jones.
Ross: My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?
Ross: Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Ross: Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
Ross: Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (The money) back in my pocket, pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah, actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…
Ross: (To Katie) Yeah, I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. (Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not because I’m-I’m into S&amp;M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’m not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So, I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)
Ross: Hey.
Ross: How are you?
Ross: Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Ross: What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
Ross: I liked her.
Ross: Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
Ross: Why? What was wrong with her?
Ross: Okay, so what’s the matter?
Ross: (laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the time.
Ross: True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.
Ross: Do you feel better?
Ross: Uh Rach?
Ross: Just one thing umm…
Ross: We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?
Ross: Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like you did last night when I had to pee?
Ross: (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…
Ross: …that you actually…
Ross: Rach?
Ross: The bathroom?
Ross: Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Ross: Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Ross: Now I cannot wait to see this.
Ross: Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)
Ross: Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. (He sits back down.)
Ross: (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
Ross: Rach, we gotta go.
Ross: People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.
Ross: Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…
Ross: Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. (She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
Ross: Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: Mmm?
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.
Ross: Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.
Ross: Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
Ross: (to Rachel) Oh, you’re nice to her.
Ross: Do them!!
Ross: You’ve got to be kidding me!
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Ross: It’s sex.
Ross: Monica!
Ross: Monica, what is the matter with you?
Ross: What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)
Ross: What?!
Ross: Can I get some of that action?
Ross: Come on, finish your enchilada.
Ross: Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot! (Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
Ross: Stop it.
Ross: I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.
Ross: This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.
Ross: Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
Ross: I love when you talk dirty to me.
Ross: Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Ross: Y’know what?
Ross: Forget it.
Ross: I’m getting that baby out of you!
Ross: Oh, I know.
Ross: I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Ross: Hey!
Ross: We’re having a baby.
Ross: Not so much.
Ross: All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
Ross: No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
Ross: Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
Ross: N… No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
Ross: Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Ross: Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: I really think they’re out of rooms.
Ross: Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by Rachel.) Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?
Ross: What-what?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.
Ross: Hi! Hi, I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.
Ross: Hi Julie.
Ross: This is Rachel. (Points at her.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
Ross: Oh, okay.
Ross: What?
Ross: Oh. Okay, just breathe.
Ross: (simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.
Ross: Uh yes! Thank you.
Ross: Later.
Ross: Oh uh, I’m sorry. (Runs out.)
Ross: Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.
Ross: Oh good.
Ross: Okay, what’s up?
Ross: Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?
Ross: Mom no, come on! Thank you.
Ross: N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant, okay?
Ross: Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…
Ross: Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)
Ross: …she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.
Ross: Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?
Ross: Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?
Ross: What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Ross: Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Ross: Yeah? Okay.
Ross: Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)
Ross: No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)
Ross: Just ignore them.
Ross: What? What?
Ross: (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Ross: The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.
Ross: That’s it. That’s it.
Ross: Just three?! I’m dilated three!
Ross: Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)
Ross: Uh Rach…
Ross: And yet somehow it’s true!
Ross: (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
Ross: (softly) Really?
Ross: Oh there you go!
Ross: No-no. We…
Ross: Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.
Ross: Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
Ross: Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Ross: Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
Ross: Sweetie you’re doing great.
Ross: What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
Ross: What is that?
Ross: Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
Ross: Go!
Ross: Yes you can!
Ross: Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!
Ross: No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking him down.)
Ross: (from the floor) Keep pushing!
Ross: You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!
Ross: Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
Ross: Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.
Ross: Oh she’s…she’s perfect.
Ross: Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.
Ross: Oh, come in.
Ross: The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.
Ross: Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.
Ross: Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?
Ross: Umm, Delilah.
Ross: So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl.
Ross: Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
Ross: (entering) Hey Janice!
Ross: Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)
Ross: No-no. No.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Ross: Huh?
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?
Ross: I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?
Ross: Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
Ross: Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma now.)
Ross: Look at Emma!
Ross: Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.
Ross: It’s…it’s complicated okay?
Ross: Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.
Ross: Yeah, exactly.
Ross: Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
Ross: You’re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.) (To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Ross: Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
Ross: What?
Ross: Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?
Ross: Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want, but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.
Ross: What about Ben?
Ross: Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Ross: Yeah right.
Ross: What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Ross: Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!
Ross: I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Ross: (noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s head to look at Emma.)
Ross: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)
Ross: Dad, what are you doing?
Ross: No!
Ross: Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)
Ross: Hi!
Ross: What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
Ross: What?
Ross: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.
Ross: (pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
Ross: No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.
Ross: What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!
Ross: I didn’t give her that ring!
Ross: No!
Ross: It’s mine.
Ross: Yes!
Ross: No!
Ross: No!!
Ross: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.
Ross: Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Ross: Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause) Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.
Ross: And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.
Ross: I don’t think you do.
Ross: Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.
Ross: Joey proposed to you?
Ross: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
Ross: Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?
Ross: Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Ross: Then what did happen?
Ross: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
Ross: What?!
Ross: Uhh… No.
Ross: But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.
Ross: No, you didn’t!
Ross: (To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!
Ross: Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!
Ross: What?
Ross: Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
Ross: Good weird?
Ross: We’re so lucky.
Ross: Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
Ross: Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.
Ross: And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Ross: When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?
Ross: You said you’d marry Joey?
Ross: So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Ross: So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
Ross: Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah! (points at Rachel)
Ross: Rachel said she’d marry you?!
Ross: (enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Ross: In the closet.
Ross: Linen closet.
Ross: In the hospital.
Ross: No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.
Ross: Sure what kind?
Ross: Please take your time, it’s an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Ross: Blueberry it is.
Ross: Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)
Ross: Yep.
Ross: Yep, can you believe it?
Ross: Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?
Ross: Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off) 
Ross: (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!
Ross: Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Ross: And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why couldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.
Ross: Not using it right, Joe.
Ross: I’m gonna go.
Ross: Give me the bag.
Ross: Joey!
Ross: I’m not gonna hit you.
Ross: No I don’t.
Ross: No.
Ross: No!
Ross: Give me the bag.
Ross: Give me the bag.
Ross: Joey, give me the bag.
Ross: Joe I’m not kidding…
Ross: No!
Ross: You ducked!!
Ross: Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Ross: What is the matter with you?!?
Ross: Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Ross: I broke my thumb.
Ross: You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can’t)
Ross: Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)
Ross: Just Ross!
Ross: You know my birthday.
Ross: October 18th.
Ross: Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
Ross: Ah, Rachel I guess.
Ross: Just ah… just put roommate.
Ross: I don’t think that we are.
Ross: Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.
Ross: Yeah that’s what she said.
Ross: So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
Ross: You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) I’m fine.
Ross: Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
Ross: Okay.
Ross: What, Rach?
Ross: (smiles) Right.
Ross: Well, that’s what I’m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want me to get that?
Ross: Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the   way over here for?
Ross: Oh my God!
Ross: Monday?!
Ross: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this   group together!
Ross: Not you.
Ross: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee   won't affect your milk.
Ross: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little   question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Ross: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Ross: (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!
Ross: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. 
Ross: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Ross: Well, what was it?
Ross: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any   little thing comes up. 
Ross: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a   good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Ross: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another   doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Ross: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!   (Walks back into his room.)
Ross: (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!
Ross: Thanks doctor.
Ross: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of   a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's   a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,   he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
Ross: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!
Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Ross: Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby   with the rash came in after me.
Ross: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Ross: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Ross: I am a single parent.
Ross: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the   pediatrician's office.
Ross: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come   on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Ross: Hey, I helped you find Waldo! 
Ross: (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.
Ross: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was   some guy that freaked everybody out.
Ross: Oh man.
Ross: sure.
Ross: people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed   up.
Ross: oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
Ross: you know I really admire your whole dating attitude,   it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow?   Where's this going?
Ross: but you, your so much better off you just go from   guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Ross: There isn't that's what I'm saying. (All happy)
Ross: I know and yet here you are all ready for the next   date.
Ross: no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you   don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Ross: please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know   what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
Ross: I'm sorry I didn't catch.
Ross: Oh Ross Geller
Ross: do you have a compact in your purse?
Ross: you look great.
Ross: so how'd the date go?
Ross: So he hasn't called?
Ross: now I feel terrible this is all my fault.
Ross: We are a rare breed.
Ross: (He knocks at the door, Mike opens it) Hey Mike sorry   to just drop by like this, can I come in?
Ross: I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
Ross: yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.
Ross: (laughs) No
Ross: Damn super cuts!
Ross: oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot   look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Ross: yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never   having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,   a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Ross: well then I didn't need to bother you or the four   other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Ross: of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship   I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Ross: yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about   to say Vis-à-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship   since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Ross: WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: YAY! (He continues the happiness with her by dancing   around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
Ross: oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there   to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended   up telling him that.
Ross: umm. that you had a six year long relationship with   a guy named Vicrum.
Ross: well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in   a serious relationship.
Ross: well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know   a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he   used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)
Ross: Good yeah just be honest with him.
Ross: I'll get it
Ross: (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it   up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.
Ross: So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
Rachel: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us  has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should go to  dinner?
Ross: Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Ross: Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Ross: Alright, well just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up)  Huh, that was my mom, shes stuck in terrible traffic.
Ross: Oh, what were the other two?
Ross: I know, its the first time, were leaving the baby and  hey, I  know how hard it is for you, but  but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be  with her. Shes great with kids.
Ross: Ya.
Ross: Hey, you only heard Monicas side of that. That little fatso was  a terror.
Ross: Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Ross: Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why dont you, why  dont you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then Ill  meet you there.
Ross: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the  world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)
Ross: Im serious. Cmon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside,  while she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.
Ross: No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [cant get in  there] (?), the babys fine, now squam (?). Yeah, [I told you a|Tell your] story  walking. (?)
Ross: Oh, (door is locked) holy molly are we in a pickle now.
Ross: Okay, well the ??? is not home.
Ross: Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has  the keys.
Ross: I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, yyou know,  everything is gonna be fine. The babys sleeping.
Ross: Cant hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Ross: Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull  yourself together, okay?
Ross: You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in 609 -  TOW Ross Got High, first aired 1999-11-25.)
Ross: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think youre right. I think   listen, listen!
Ross: A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no  wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby,  seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birds aid. The eagle,  however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon.  Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays  (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the  apartment.
Ross: Great. So lets get going?
Ross: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Ross: Im so sorry 
Ross: And then Rachel wasnt sure she could leave the baby.
Ross: What?
Ross: Thanks. Oh.
Ross: Yknow this ??? is incredible.
Ross: Okay, Ill have the fixed salad and the duck.
Ross: Rach, cmon, Emma is fine. Youre turning into an obsessive  mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Ross: (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.
Ross: W-oa  Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
Ross: Well, ??? think thats us?
Ross: You know, I think thats a good ideaour babysitter just pounded  in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, yguys.
Ross: A lot of people are thankful for those. &lt; knock on door&gt; 
Ross: Hey Amy. 
Ross: That was me.
Ross: Sure, we don't live there but...
Ross: I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Ross: Don't say that.
Ross: Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Ross: You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like   the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Ross: Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I   don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job. 
Monica to Ross: Hi.
Ross: Emma. 
Ross: Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would   want Monica and Chandler. 
Ross: well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma   would go to my parents. 
Ross: Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like   Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. 
Ross: No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're   strongest when.. when you're together. 
Ross: Sure, Monica would have to give her up. 
Ross: Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
Ross: Emma. 
Rachel turns to Ross: Oh whose side are you on? &lt;back   to Amy&gt; I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle   the responibility of a child. 
Monica screaming at Ross: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't   time! 
Ross: Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel   dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. 
Ross: So, so now do I get Joey?
Ross: You're really not coming back?
Ross: I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Ross: You got me a cola drink?
Ross: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Ross: Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ross: What are you doing here, Santa?
Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Ross: (to Chandler) What are you doing?
Ross: Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
Ross: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
Ross: I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
Ross: (in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!
Ross: (in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!
Ross: Really? You're not gonna return it?
Ross: Wow, it really is!
Ross: Oh my god...
Ross: What, you, you really quit your job?
Ross: Oh, hey...
Ross: (reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Ross: Hey you guys!
Ross: Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points    to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.
Ross: Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Ross: Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there    in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me    feel like I earned it.
Ross: Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you    - wovyou dovyou ...
Ross: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just    forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Ross: What are you, a child?
Ross: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy    on someone else.
Ross: Whazzup??
Ross: Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep    an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Ross: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked    for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
Ross: You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm    sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do    this for me?
Ross: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)  
Ross: I am, yes.
Ross: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Ross: We have to stop them before something happens!
Ross: Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Ross: Thanx.
Ross: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Ross: Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Ross: Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have    no problem.

Ross: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Yeah, that'll do it.
Ross: I'm, I'm okay. 
Ross: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have       worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's       a divorce.
Ross: No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel       and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing       other people.
Ross: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good       for me...
Ross: Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Ross: Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,       dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
Ross: Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
Ross: Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home       alone.
Ross: Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Ross: No! 
Ross: Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Ross: Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to       have sex tonight.
Ross: Just the crab cakes.
Ross: What's - what's going on?
Ross: What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Ross: This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.       Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Ross: Hey, what's wrong?
Ross: Oh. Crab cake?
Ross: Well, what happened?
Ross: Monica told me you had a blind date.
Ross: I did, too.
Ross: But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Ross: Why does everyone keep saying that?
Ross: That bad?
Ross: Female body inspector? What size is that?
Ross: The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
Ross: Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's       just stupid.
Ross: I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the       chances?
Monica, Chandler, Ross: Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Ross: I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great!   I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Ross: Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for   all hanging out but to come to my home!
Ross: Why?
Ross: Never?
Ross: wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Ross: Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight   and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Ross: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now   but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Ross: If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer".   It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love   to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before   she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
Ross: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have   so much fun and you love Mike.
Ross: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and   you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Ross: The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Ross: Yeah I just hurt it.
Ross: Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the   other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Ross: Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised   I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Ross: Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in   the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly   picture yourself in a Volvo?
Ross: I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Ross: Hey hey, can I help?
Ross: You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Ross: Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Ross: Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Ross: It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Ross: Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... 
Ross: No... I already e-mailed her.
Ross: You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Ross: (he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
Ross: (he comes back) Alright, let's go!
Ross: I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Ross: (yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
Ross: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!
Ross: I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Ross: You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Ross: Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Ross: (visibly upset) I'm dead?
Ross: Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Ross: Oh please, hit by a blimp?
Ross: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Ross: You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Ross: uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
Ross: Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Ross: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Ross: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
Ross: You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Ross: Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
Ross: No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Ross: oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... 
Ross: It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Ross: Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
Ross: Who is he?
Ross: I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
Ross: (coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
Ross: It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
Ross: Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Ross: (sceptical) Yeah... 
Ross: (he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Ross: Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Ross: (on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!
Ross: No thanks!
Ross: (in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Ross: The woman just vanished!
Ross: No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Ross: Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Ross: Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Ross: (yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
Ross: (panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Ross: Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Ross: (to Monica)Think he washed his hands?
Ross: (mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Ross: (mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
Ross: You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
Ross: Uh, you're not gonna win.
Ross: Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
Ross: Why would I eat my own arm?
Ross: Why?
Ross: You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here (they kiss and hug)
Ross: I don't know, probably just invest it.
Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away" (Joey and Chandler pleased)
Ross: (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
Ross: Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
Ross: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
Ross: I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Ross: (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.
Ross: I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Ross: 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Ross: Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Ross: (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!
Ross: Monica!
Ross: Go, go, go!!
Ross: Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
Ross: Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
Ross: (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel) Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)
Ross: Oh, we have one too!!
Ross: (calling Rachel) Come on!!
Ross: Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
Ross: Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Ross: Okay, what does it mean?
Ross: I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).
Ross: Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Ross: Ok, use it in a sentence.
Ross: It's not a word!
Ross: Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
Ross: She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head, very moved)
Ross: Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
Monica and Ross: Seven.
Ross: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
Ross: I guess if everybody else is...
(Rachel comes out of her room and starts staring at him unseen)Joey: I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you. Rachel: I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a  cantaloupe might hurt less. Joey: Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good! Rachel: Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog! Joey: Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok? Rachel: (excited) Are you serious? Joey: Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again. Rachel: Hey, that was an honest mistake! Joey: Right!(he starts to ape her)"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts) Rachel: Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits [Scene: Central Perk] Monica: Hey! Phoebe: Hey! Ross: Hi! Monica: So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks? Phoebe: Sure! Ross: I'd love to! Monica: Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month! Phoebe: Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again! Ross: Phoebe, what happened? Phoebe: Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! (Chandler enters)Chandler: (To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags! Phoebe: Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years! Chandler: What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)! Phoebe: Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic! Chandler: So, what do you say? Can you get out of work? Monica: Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant! Chandler: Are you really that busy? Monica: Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am. Chandler: Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?" Monica: Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant! Phoebe: And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing! Chandler: (on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont... Ross: Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance. Chandler: I don't have travel insurance. Ross: Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge! Monica: Why don't you take Ross? Ross: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn... Monica: No, not if their room has two beds! Ross: (browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!! [Scene: Days of Our Lives' Studios] Rachel: Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity? Joey: I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes! Rachel: Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous! Joey: Also so gay! Rachel: Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"! Joey: Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff! Director: Joey, Joey! We're ready for you! Joey: Oh, wish me luck! Rachel: Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right? Joey: Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this! Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug) Director: On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION! (the scene starts.Joey enters and there's a girl wearing a wedding dress near a bed)Actress/Olivia: Drake! What are you doing in here? Joey/Drake: Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life. Actress/Olivia: Get out! Joey/Drake: You don't love him! Actress/Olivia: What do you know about love? Joey/Drake: I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge. Actress/Olivia: That kiss never happened. Joey/Drake: Oh, what about this one. (the actress slaps him)Rachel: (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH! Actress/Olivia: No, I told you...get out! Joey/Drake: Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question... Chase Lassiter: (talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we... Rachel: SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!! Joey/Drake: Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been? Actress/Olivia: I don't have a choice... Joey/Drake: Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you. Actress/Olivia: Don't say that... Joey/Drake: Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her) Director: CUT! Rachel: NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call! [Scene: Monica's restaurant] 1st Customer: Everything was delicious! Monica: Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb. Monica: Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint. Monica: Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer! Monica: What musician? [Scene: Outside the restaurant] Phoebe: (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè! Monica: What are you doing here! Phoebe: Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain! Monica: Great! Phoebe: Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home". Monica: Listen Phoebe... Phoebe: Yeah. Monica: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but... Phoebe: But what? Monica: This is kind of a classy place. Phoebe: (pause) Ok, say no more. [Time lapse: Phoebe in front of restaurant again] Phoebe: (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh? (Monica covers her face with her hands)[Scene: hall of the romantic inn in Vermont] Chandler: Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation. Receptionist: Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from? Chandler: New York. Ross: (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple! Chandler: I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. Ross: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody. Receptionist: I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer. Chandler: Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please? Ross: (high pitched voice) Check again please! Receptionist: I'm sorry, it's not here. Ross: Not there. Chandler: Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation? Receptionist: I don't know what to say. Ross: (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say! Chandler: Just give us the cheapest room you have. Receptionist: Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars. Chandler: That's insane! Ross: Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves. Chandler: Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it. Receptionist: Great. Chandler: (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off! Ross: Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six! Chandler: Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there! Ross: C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time! Chandler: Dude, you're shaking! Ross: I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple? [Scene: Joey's apartment] Rachel: Hi! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing! Joey: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me! Rachel: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! Joey: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me? Rachel: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress. Joey: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica. Rachel: Oh screw her, that part is mine! Joey: Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. Rachel: Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here. Joey/Drake: I can't believe you married him. Rachel/actress: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon! Joey/Drake: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other. Rachel/actress: It's over! You have to accept that. Joey/Drake: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now. Rachel: (pause) Kiss me. Joey: What? Rachel: Kiss me. Joey: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that! Rachel: No, I'm saying... Joey: but, but.. Rachel: just... don't talk... (she kisses him) [Scene: Rachel's bedroom] Rachel: (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new! [Scene: Hotel's room] Ross: (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.  (Chandler enters the room)Ross: What did you get? Chandler: USA Today Ross: Nice, put it with the others. Chandler: And I also got... two more apples. Ross: We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!   Chandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. Ross: Oh, that's not cool. Chandlers: Dude, none of this is cool. Ross: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through. Chandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that. Ross: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend. Chandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)? Ross: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control! Chandler: Yes, but the batteries... (Ross claps his hands)Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much! Ross: Let's celebrate with some maple candy! Chandler: No! Ross: At least tell me where you hid it. [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa] Rachel: Can I ask you a question? Monica: Yeah. Rachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? Monica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head. Rachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey. Monica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him? Rachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense. Monica: What do you think brought than on? Rachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday. Monica: A love scene? With who? Rachel: Olivia. Monica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important. Rachel: So do you think that my dream means anything? Monica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake. Rachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream... Monica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.  Rachel: You took the same class twice. Monica: It was hard! (Phoebe comes in)Phoebe: Hey! Rachel and Monica: Hi. Phoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. Monica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. Phoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. Monica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. Phoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot). (silence)Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? Rachel: Ok, we're still on that. Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough. Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? Monica: Tiny portions? Phoebe: Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"! Monica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity. Phoebe: Well...it's not about quality. Monica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in. Phoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica. Monica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs. Phoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? Monica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. Phoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini? [Scene: Hotel's reception] Receptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. Chandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. (the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax. Ross: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. (they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)Ross: Oh my god. Chandler: What? Ross: There's something new in the bowl. Chandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away. Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones! Chandler: There's a forest right outside. Ross: It's not the same. Chandler: Ok, go quick! (Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay. (he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross: Oh, my maple candy! [Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing] Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. (Monica comes out)Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now. Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on! Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me! Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha! Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again). Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands). Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand) Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand) Monica: I'm sorry... Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug) Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?  Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...  (Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in] Rachel: Hey! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all! Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...? Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?  Rachel: uh-huh Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!  Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake... Joey: What? Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake? Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well... Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good! Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. Rachel: So? Joey: So...I've never played that! Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you... Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about?? Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before... Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. (Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room) Closing credits  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area] Chandler: I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table) Monica: (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty! (Then Ross enters)Ross: (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing? 
Ross: Hi!
Ross: I'd love to!
Ross: Phoebe, what happened?

No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)! Phoebe: Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic! Chandler: So, what do you say? Can you get out of work? Monica: Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant! Chandler: Are you really that busy? Monica: Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am. Chandler: Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?" Monica: Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant! Phoebe: And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing! Chandler: (on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont... Ross: Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance. Chandler: I don't have travel insurance. Ross: Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge! Monica: Why don't you take Ross? Ross: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn... Monica: No, not if their room has two beds! Ross: (browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!! [Scene: Days of Our Lives' Studios] Rachel: Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity? Joey: I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach.

We're ready for you! Joey: Oh, wish me luck! Rachel: Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right? Joey: Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this! Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug) Director: On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION! (the scene starts.Joey enters and there's a girl wearing a wedding dress near a bed)Actress/Olivia: Drake! What are you doing in here? Joey/Drake: Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life. Actress/Olivia: Get out! Joey/Drake: You don't love him! Actress/Olivia: What do you know about love? Joey/Drake: I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge. Actress/Olivia: That kiss never happened. Joey/Drake: Oh, what about this one. (the actress slaps him)Rachel: (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH! Actress/Olivia: No, I told you...get out! Joey/Drake: Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question... Chase Lassiter: (talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we... Rachel: SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!! Joey/Drake: Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been? Actress/Olivia: I don't have a choice... Joey/Drake: Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you. Actress/Olivia: Don't say that... Joey/Drake: Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her) Director: CUT! Rachel: NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call! [Scene: Monica's restaurant] 1st Customer: Everything was delicious! Monica: Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb. Monica: Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint. Monica: Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer! Monica: What musician? [Scene: Outside the restaurant] Phoebe: (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè! Monica: What are you doing here! Phoebe: Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain! Monica: Great! Phoebe: Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home". Monica: Listen Phoebe... Phoebe: Yeah. Monica: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but... Phoebe: But what? Monica: This is kind of a classy place. Phoebe: (pause) Ok, say no more. [Time lapse: Phoebe in front of restaurant again] Phoebe: (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh? (Monica covers her face with her hands)[Scene: hall of the romantic inn in Vermont] Chandler: Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation. Receptionist: Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from? Chandler: New York. Ross: (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple! Chandler: I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. Ross: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody. Receptionist: I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer. Chandler: Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please? Ross: (high pitched voice) Check again please! Receptionist: I'm sorry, it's not here. Ross: Not there. Chandler: Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation? Receptionist: I don't know what to say. Ross: (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say! Chandler: Just give us the cheapest room you have. Receptionist: Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars. Chandler: That's insane! Ross: Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves. Chandler: Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it. Receptionist: Great. Chandler: (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off! Ross: Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six! Chandler: Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there! Ross: C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time! Chandler: Dude, you're shaking! Ross: I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple? [Scene: Joey's apartment] Rachel: Hi! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing! Joey: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me! Rachel: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! Joey: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me? Rachel: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress. Joey: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica. Rachel: Oh screw her, that part is mine! Joey: Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. Rachel: Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here. Joey/Drake: I can't believe you married him. Rachel/actress: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon! Joey/Drake: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other. Rachel/actress: It's over! You have to accept that. Joey/Drake: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now. Rachel: (pause) Kiss me. Joey: What? Rachel: Kiss me. Joey: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that! Rachel: No, I'm saying... Joey: but, but.. Rachel: just... don't talk... (she kisses him) [Scene: Rachel's bedroom] Rachel: (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new! [Scene: Hotel's room] Ross: (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.  (Chandler enters the room)Ross: What did you get? Chandler: USA Today Ross: Nice, put it with the others. Chandler: And I also got... two more apples. Ross: We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!   Chandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. Ross: Oh, that's not cool. Chandlers: Dude, none of this is cool. Ross: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through. Chandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that. Ross: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend. Chandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)? Ross: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control! Chandler: Yes, but the batteries... (Ross claps his hands)Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much! Ross: Let's celebrate with some maple candy! Chandler: No! Ross: At least tell me where you hid it. [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa] Rachel: Can I ask you a question? Monica: Yeah. Rachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? Monica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head. Rachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey. Monica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him? Rachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense. Monica: What do you think brought than on? Rachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday. Monica: A love scene? With who? Rachel: Olivia. Monica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important. Rachel: So do you think that my dream means anything? Monica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake. Rachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream... Monica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.  Rachel: You took the same class twice. Monica: It was hard! (Phoebe comes in)Phoebe: Hey! Rachel and Monica: Hi. Phoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. Monica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. Phoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. Monica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. Phoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot). (silence)Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? Rachel: Ok, we're still on that. Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough. Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? Monica: Tiny portions? Phoebe: Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"! Monica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity. Phoebe: Well...it's not about quality. Monica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in. Phoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica. Monica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs. Phoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? Monica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. Phoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini? [Scene: Hotel's reception] Receptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. Chandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. (the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax. Ross: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. (they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)Ross: Oh my god. Chandler: What? Ross: There's something new in the bowl. Chandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away. Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones! Chandler: There's a forest right outside. Ross: It's not the same. Chandler: Ok, go quick! (Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay. (he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross: Oh, my maple candy! [Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing] Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. (Monica comes out)Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now. Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on! Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me! Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha! Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again). Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands). Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand) Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand) Monica: I'm sorry... Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug) Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?  Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...  (Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in] Rachel: Hey! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all! Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...? Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?  Rachel: uh-huh Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!  Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake... Joey: What? Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake? Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well... Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good! Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. Rachel: So? Joey: So...I've never played that! Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you... Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about?? Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before... Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. (Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room) Closing credits  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area] Chandler: I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table) Monica: (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty! (Then Ross enters)Ross: (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing? 
Ross: Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
Ross: Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Ross: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Ross: (browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!

Monica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.  Rachel: You took the same class twice. Monica: It was hard! (Phoebe comes in)Phoebe: Hey! Rachel and Monica: Hi. Phoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. Monica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. Phoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. Monica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. Phoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot). (silence)Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? Rachel: Ok, we're still on that. Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough. Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? Monica: Tiny portions? Phoebe: Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"! Monica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity. Phoebe: Well...it's not about quality. Monica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in. Phoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica. Monica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs. Phoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? Monica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. Phoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini? [Scene: Hotel's reception] Receptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. Chandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. (the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax. Ross: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. (they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)Ross: Oh my god. Chandler: What? Ross: There's something new in the bowl. Chandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away. Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones! Chandler: There's a forest right outside. Ross: It's not the same. Chandler: Ok, go quick! (Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay. (he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross: Oh, my maple candy! [Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing] Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. (Monica comes out)Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now. Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on! Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me! Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha! Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again). Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands). Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand) Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand) Monica: I'm sorry... Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug) Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?  Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...  (Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in] Rachel: Hey! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all! Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...? Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?  Rachel: uh-huh Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!  Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake... Joey: What? Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake? Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well... Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good! Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. Rachel: So? Joey: So...I've never played that! Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you... Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about?? Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before... Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. (Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room) Closing credits  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area] Chandler: I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table) Monica: (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty! (Then Ross enters)Ross: (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing? 
(the actress slaps him)Rachel: (watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH! Actress/Olivia: No, I told you...get out! Joey/Drake: Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question... Chase Lassiter: (talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we... Rachel: SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!! Joey/Drake: Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been? Actress/Olivia: I don't have a choice... Joey/Drake: Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you. Actress/Olivia: Don't say that... Joey/Drake: Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her) Director: CUT! Rachel: NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call! [Scene: Monica's restaurant] 1st Customer: Everything was delicious! Monica: Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb. Monica: Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint. Monica: Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer! Monica: What musician? [Scene: Outside the restaurant] Phoebe: (playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè! Monica: What are you doing here! Phoebe: Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain! Monica: Great! Phoebe: Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home". Monica: Listen Phoebe... Phoebe: Yeah. Monica: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but... Phoebe: But what? Monica: This is kind of a classy place. Phoebe: (pause) Ok, say no more. [Time lapse: Phoebe in front of restaurant again] Phoebe: (with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh? (Monica covers her face with her hands)[Scene: hall of the romantic inn in Vermont] Chandler: Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation. Receptionist: Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from? Chandler: New York. Ross: (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple! Chandler: I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here. Ross: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody. Receptionist: I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer. Chandler: Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please? Ross: (high pitched voice) Check again please! Receptionist: I'm sorry, it's not here. Ross: Not there. Chandler: Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation? Receptionist: I don't know what to say. Ross: (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say! Chandler: Just give us the cheapest room you have. Receptionist: Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars. Chandler: That's insane! Ross: Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves. Chandler: Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it. Receptionist: Great. Chandler: (aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off! Ross: Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six! Chandler: Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there! Ross: C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time! Chandler: Dude, you're shaking! Ross: I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple? [Scene: Joey's apartment] Rachel: Hi! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing! Joey: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me! Rachel: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! Joey: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me? Rachel: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress. Joey: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica. Rachel: Oh screw her, that part is mine! Joey: Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. Rachel: Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here. Joey/Drake: I can't believe you married him. Rachel/actress: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon! Joey/Drake: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other. Rachel/actress: It's over! You have to accept that. Joey/Drake: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now. Rachel: (pause) Kiss me. Joey: What? Rachel: Kiss me. Joey: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that! Rachel: No, I'm saying... Joey: but, but.. Rachel: just... don't talk... (she kisses him) [Scene: Rachel's bedroom] Rachel: (waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new! [Scene: Hotel's room] Ross: (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.  (Chandler enters the room)Ross: What did you get? Chandler: USA Today Ross: Nice, put it with the others. Chandler: And I also got... two more apples. Ross: We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!   Chandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. Ross: Oh, that's not cool. Chandlers: Dude, none of this is cool. Ross: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through. Chandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that. Ross: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend. Chandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)? Ross: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control! Chandler: Yes, but the batteries... (Ross claps his hands)Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much! Ross: Let's celebrate with some maple candy! Chandler: No! Ross: At least tell me where you hid it. [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa] Rachel: Can I ask you a question? Monica: Yeah. Rachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? Monica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head. Rachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey. Monica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him? Rachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense. Monica: What do you think brought than on? Rachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday. Monica: A love scene? With who? Rachel: Olivia. Monica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important. Rachel: So do you think that my dream means anything? Monica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake. Rachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream... Monica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.  Rachel: You took the same class twice. Monica: It was hard!

[Scene: Hotel's room] Ross: (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.  (Chandler enters the room)Ross: What did you get? Chandler: USA Today Ross: Nice, put it with the others. Chandler: And I also got... two more apples. Ross: We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!   Chandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. Ross: Oh, that's not cool. Chandlers: Dude, none of this is cool. Ross: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through. Chandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that. Ross: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend. Chandler: Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)? Ross: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control! Chandler: Yes, but the batteries... (Ross claps his hands)Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much! Ross: Let's celebrate with some maple candy! Chandler: No! Ross: At least tell me where you hid it. [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa] Rachel: Can I ask you a question? Monica: Yeah. Rachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? Monica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head. Rachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey. Monica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him? Rachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense. Monica: What do you think brought than on? Rachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday. Monica: A love scene? With who? Rachel: Olivia. Monica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important. Rachel: So do you think that my dream means anything? Monica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake. Rachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream... Monica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.  Rachel: You took the same class twice. Monica: It was hard! (Phoebe comes in)Phoebe: Hey! Rachel and Monica: Hi. Phoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. Monica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. Phoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. Monica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. Phoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot). (silence)Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? Rachel: Ok, we're still on that. Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough. Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? Monica: Tiny portions? Phoebe: Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"! Monica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity. Phoebe: Well...it's not about quality. Monica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in. Phoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica. Monica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs. Phoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? Monica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. Phoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini? [Scene: Hotel's reception] Receptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. Chandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. (the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax. Ross: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. (they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)Ross: Oh my god. Chandler: What? Ross: There's something new in the bowl. Chandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away. Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones! Chandler: There's a forest right outside. Ross: It's not the same. Chandler: Ok, go quick! (Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay. (he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross: Oh, my maple candy! [Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing] Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. (Monica comes out)Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now. Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on! Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me! Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha! Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again). Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands). Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand) Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand) Monica: I'm sorry... Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug) Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?  Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...  (Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in] Rachel: Hey! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all! Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...? Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?  Rachel: uh-huh Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!  Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake... Joey: What? Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake? Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well... Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good! Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. Rachel: So? Joey: So...I've never played that! Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you... Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about?? Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before... Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. (Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room) Closing credits  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area] Chandler: I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table) Monica: (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty! (Then Ross enters)Ross: (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing? 
Ross: (in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
Ross: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Ross: (high pitched voice) Check again please!
Ross: Not there.
Ross: (mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
Ross: Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Ross: Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
Ross: C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Ross: I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Ross: (on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something...

Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha! Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again). Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands). Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand) Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand) Monica: I'm sorry... Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug) Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?  Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...  (Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in] Rachel: Hey! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all! Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...? Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?  Rachel: uh-huh Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!  Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake... Joey: What? Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake? Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well... Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good! Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. Rachel: So? Joey: So...I've never played that! Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you... Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about?? Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before... Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. (Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room) Closing credits  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area] Chandler: I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table) Monica: (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty! (Then Ross enters)Ross: (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing? 
Ross: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Ross: At least tell me where you hid it.
(Phoebe comes in)Phoebe: Hey! Rachel and Monica: Hi. Phoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. Monica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. Phoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. Monica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. Phoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot). (silence)Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... Phoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? Rachel: Ok, we're still on that. Monica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough. Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? Monica: Tiny portions? Phoebe: Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"! Monica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity. Phoebe: Well...it's not about quality. Monica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in. Phoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica. Monica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs. Phoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? Monica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. Phoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini? [Scene: Hotel's reception] Receptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. Chandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. (the receptions is puzzled. She goes in the back.)Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax. Ross: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. (they make as if to go, but Ross notices something)Ross: Oh my god. Chandler: What? Ross: There's something new in the bowl. Chandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away. Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones! Chandler: There's a forest right outside. Ross: It's not the same. Chandler: Ok, go quick! (Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay. (he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross: Oh, my maple candy! [Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing] Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. (Monica comes out)Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now. Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on! Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me! Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?

Phoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Monica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands). Monica: Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand) Phoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand) Monica: I'm sorry... Phoebe: I'm sorry too... (they hug) Monica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?  Phoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...  (Monica seems to take it amiss)Phoebe: (smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in] Rachel: Hey! Joey: Hey! Rachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? Joey: (Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all! Rachel: (looks puzzled) How...how...? Joey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?  Rachel: uh-huh Joey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!  Rachel: (to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake... Joey: What? Rachel: What...how is it going with Drake? Joey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well... Rachel: What...that scene I saw was so good! Joey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... Rachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? Joey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. Rachel: So? Joey: So...I've never played that! Rachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Joey: Uh...well...just once...with you... Rachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Joey: (looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about?? Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey: (approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Rachel: (looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before... Joey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. (Joey and Rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)Joey: (excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room) Closing credits  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartement, Monica is at the kitchen table writing something and Chandler enters kitchen area] Chandler: I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table) Monica: (without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty! (Then Ross enters)Ross: (sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing? 
Ross: Oh my god.
Ross: There's something new in the bowl.
Ross: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Ross: It's not the same.
(Ross starts stuffing pinecones in the suitcase. As the receptionist walks in, Chandler makes a bird's verse and Ross stops)Ross: (to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay. (he picks up the suitcase, which falls open, revealing all the stuff they have taken from the hotel. The receptionist just looks at them.)Ross: Oh, my maple candy! [Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing] Phoebe: (singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. (Monica comes out)Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. Phoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Monica: Ok, you have to stop playing now. Phoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Monica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on! Phoebe: (while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me! Monica: (to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands) Phoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha! Monica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).

(Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said. Monica: In the hall. [Scene: In the hall] Monica: You wanna fool around with Joey? Rachel: Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time! Monica: Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around? Rachel: Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet. Monica: Who, who are they? Rachel: I know them from work. Monica: Both of them? Rachel: No, one of them... Monica: Which one? Rachel: I don't know, what were the names I just said? Monica: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated. Rachel: All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?

Ross: Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today. Chandler: Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs. Ross: (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus. Monica: What's so bad about that? Ross: It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches. Monica: (fingering her elbow): Ross? Ross: (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede. (a woman walks in)Charlie: (to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller? Gunther: No. Ross: Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller. Charlie: Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer. Ross: Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice. Charlie: It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around. Ross: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out. Monica: (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us? Chandler: (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now. Charlie: And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis. Ross: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute. Monica: (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month. Ross: (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover. Charlie: Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us? Ross: I don't think so. Charlie: I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell? Ross: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we? Charlie: You don't think we should wait for him? Ross: You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok? Professor Spafford: Professor Geller? Ross: Oh, damn it! [Scene: Joey's apartment] (Rachel enters the room and checks the answering machine)Jane: (from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye. Joey: (entering the room) Hey! Rachel: Hey! Joey: What's happenin'? Rachel: Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight. Joey: Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine) Message: "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" (Joey's upset and stops it) Joey: (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!! Rachel: (angry) You are having a party tonight?? Joey: Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people. Rachel: And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that? Joey: I do it every year. Rachel: You do that every year?? Joey: I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!! Rachel: Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us?? Joey: Yeah... Rachel: And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant? Joey: Yeah... Rachel: OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory? Joey: (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one! Rachel: Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties? Joey: You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people! Rachel: Well, then so you just invite me...! Joey: (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one! Rachel: Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please... Joey: Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8. Rachel: (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system! [Scene: Ross, Charlie and Professor Spafford are sitting at the table in a restaurant] Professor Spafford: (speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish. Ross: (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree? Professor Spafford: And that's not all I'm allergic to. Ross: (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over! Professor Spafford: I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts... Ross: So basically all nuts? Professor Spafford: Interestingly... no. Charlie: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting". Professor Spafford: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away) Charlie: Oh my God!! Ross: I've lost the will to live. Charlie: Let's ditch him! Ross: What? Charlie: Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you! Ross: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll... Charlie: Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside) [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment] Ross: (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica. Phoebe: Hi! Ross: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department. Phoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods? Charlie: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas... Phoebe: Ah, ah. Charlie: (her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment) Ross: (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation? Phoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out! Monica: (to Ross) So, did you two have fun? Ross: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny... Monica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI! Rachel: (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play. Ross: Really? Wh-what's wrong? Rachel: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!! Charlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry. Rachel: ... Ok, who is this? Ross: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue. Rachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease! Monica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec? Rachel: Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh... Monica: You're not sick! Rachel: What? Yes, I am! Monica: Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up?? Rachel: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe) Monica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey! Rachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is! Monica: Ok, what is this? Rachel: Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you! Monica: (aloud) WHAT? Ross: (looking at them) Wh-what's going on? Monica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof! Rachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!! Charlie: I thought you came to say you were sick. Rachel: Ok professor or detective? Phoebe: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us? Rachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory! Phoebe: And that horrible museum tour! Ross: No, I arranged that... (Joey enters, wearing a bathrobe)Joey: (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun. Phoebe: We know about your party Joey. Joey: What party? Monica: The game's over! Take off your robe! Joey: (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean... Everyone: No!! Cover it up!! Joey: (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves) [Scene: The Roof] Joey: (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming. Monica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder! Kyle Lowder: (to Monica) Hi. (walks on) Monica: (Yells after him) I love you! Joey: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something... Monica: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered. Phoebe: Hey! Monica: (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself. Phoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around) Monica: (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler! [Scene: The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously] Chandler: Where the hell is everybody? (The lights dim and Chandler tries to get away but as the bitter lady comes on stage and starts yelling he promptly changes his mind and sits down)Bitter lady: (yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period. [Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it] Monica: (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love". Rachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number. Monica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married! Matthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel. Rachel: Nice to meet you. Matthew Ashford: Call me. Rachel: Ok (Matthew leaves)Monica: (yelling after him) We will!! Monica: (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys! Rachel: Yeah! Monica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey? Rachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler! Monica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather) (cut to Ross and Charlie)Ross: (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh? Charlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone. Ross: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer? Charlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with. Ross: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer? Charlie: Yeah... Ross: ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby... Charlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man. Ross: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10! Charlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues... Ross: (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood". Charlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him. Ross: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: A guy who won two. Ross: (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart Charlie: Yeah... for three years. Ross: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy. Ross: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him? Charlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant. Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter) Phoebe: Hey Ross! Rache: How is it going with Charlie? Ross: (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out. Phoebe: Oh, What's the matter? Ross: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth. Rachel: I always loved that!! Ross: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God! Phoebe: Worse? Ross: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that? Phoebe: (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks) Ross: What? (turns around to look at Rachel) Rachel: Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves) [Scene: Chandler in the theater] Bitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh? Chandler: (To himself) oh yes, God yes!! Bitter lady: (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!?! Chandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely. [Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy] Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands) Ross: Nice to meet you. Dirk: Hey! So what show are you on? Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. (Dirk is confused)Joey: It's a science. Dirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize. (Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys. Dirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs. Ross: I'd lead with that. (Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so). Joey: Monica! Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! (Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)Joey: (To Rachel) What have you got there? Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers. Joey: Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty? Rachel: (drunken voice) I think I am. Joey: (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. (Rachel is puzzled)Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys? Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet. Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. Rachel: Who (looks around)? (Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)Joey: Me. Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really? Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five) Joey: Gotcha. Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey. (Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)(Chandler walks in)Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play? Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry. Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater. Monica: You really liked it? Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted. Monica: Oh really! Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period! Monica: No! Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra? Monica: So I got it when I was 13... [Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.] Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize. Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd. Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited. Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... Ross: And sexy. Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her. Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)! (Rachel approaches Monica)Rachel: (to Monica) Hey! Monica: Hey! Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea. Rachel: Please, what about you and Chandler? Monica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid! Rachel: Well hello (points to herself)! Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them? Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it. Monica: And I can't stop you. Rachel: No. (Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)Ross: (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? (Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)Ross: I'm smarter than him! Closing credits[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line] Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you. Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful. Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period. Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away). 
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Ross: (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Ross: It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Ross: (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.
(a woman walks in)Charlie: (to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller? Gunther: No. Ross: Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller. Charlie: Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer. Ross: Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice. Charlie: It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around. Ross: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out. Monica: (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us? Chandler: (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now. Charlie: And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis. Ross: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute. Monica: (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month. Ross: (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover. Charlie: Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us? Ross: I don't think so. Charlie: I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell? Ross: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?

I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10! Charlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues... Ross: (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood". Charlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him. Ross: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: A guy who won two. Ross: (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart Charlie: Yeah... for three years. Ross: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy. Ross: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him? Charlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant. Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter) Phoebe: Hey Ross! Rache: How is it going with Charlie? Ross: (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out. Phoebe: Oh, What's the matter? Ross: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth. Rachel: I always loved that!! Ross: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God! Phoebe: Worse? Ross: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that? Phoebe: (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks) Ross: What? (turns around to look at Rachel) Rachel: Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves) [Scene: Chandler in the theater] Bitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh? Chandler: (To himself) oh yes, God yes!! Bitter lady: (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!?! Chandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely. [Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy] Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands) Ross: Nice to meet you. Dirk: Hey! So what show are you on? Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. (Dirk is confused)Joey: It's a science. Dirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize. (Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys. Dirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs. Ross: I'd lead with that. (Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so). Joey: Monica! Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! (Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)Joey: (To Rachel) What have you got there? Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers. Joey: Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty? Rachel: (drunken voice) I think I am. Joey: (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. (Rachel is puzzled)Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys? Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet. Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. Rachel: Who (looks around)? (Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)Joey: Me. Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really? Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five) Joey: Gotcha. Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey. (Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)(Chandler walks in)Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play? Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry. Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater. Monica: You really liked it? Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted. Monica: Oh really! Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period! Monica: No! Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra? Monica: So I got it when I was 13... [Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.] Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize. Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd. Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited. Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... Ross: And sexy. Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her. Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)! (Rachel approaches Monica)Rachel: (to Monica) Hey! Monica: Hey! Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea. Rachel: Please, what about you and Chandler? Monica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid! Rachel: Well hello (points to herself)! Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them? Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it. Monica: And I can't stop you. Rachel: No. (Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)Ross: (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? (Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)Ross: I'm smarter than him! Closing credits[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line] Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you. Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful. Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period. Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away). 
Ross: Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
Ross: Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
Ross: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
Ross: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
Ross: (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
Ross: I don't think so.
Ross: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
Ross: You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
Ross: Oh, damn it!
(Rachel enters the room and checks the answering machine)Jane: (from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye. Joey: (entering the room) Hey! Rachel: Hey! Joey: What's happenin'? Rachel: Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight. Joey: Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine) Message: "Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" (Joey's upset and stops it) Joey: (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!! Rachel: (angry) You are having a party tonight?? Joey: Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people. Rachel: And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that? Joey: I do it every year. Rachel: You do that every year?? Joey: I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!! Rachel: Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us?? Joey: Yeah... Rachel: And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant? Joey: Yeah... Rachel: OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory? Joey: (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one! Rachel: Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties? Joey: You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people! Rachel: Well, then so you just invite me...! Joey: (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one! Rachel: Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please... Joey: Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8. Rachel: (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system! [Scene: Ross, Charlie and Professor Spafford are sitting at the table in a restaurant] Professor Spafford: (speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish. Ross: (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree? Professor Spafford: And that's not all I'm allergic to. Ross: (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over! Professor Spafford: I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts... Ross: So basically all nuts? Professor Spafford: Interestingly... no. Charlie: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting". Professor Spafford: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away) Charlie: Oh my God!! Ross: I've lost the will to live. Charlie: Let's ditch him! Ross: What? Charlie: Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you! Ross: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll... Charlie: Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside) [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment] Ross: (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica. Phoebe: Hi! Ross: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department. Phoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods? Charlie: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas... Phoebe: Ah, ah. Charlie: (her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment) Ross: (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation? Phoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out! Monica: (to Ross) So, did you two have fun? Ross: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny... Monica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI! Rachel: (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play. Ross: Really? Wh-what's wrong? Rachel: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!! Charlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry. Rachel: ... Ok, who is this? Ross: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue. Rachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease! Monica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec? Rachel: Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh... Monica: You're not sick! Rachel: What? Yes, I am! Monica: Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up?? Rachel: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe) Monica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey! Rachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is! Monica: Ok, what is this? Rachel: Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you! Monica: (aloud) WHAT? Ross: (looking at them) Wh-what's going on? Monica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof! Rachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!! Charlie: I thought you came to say you were sick. Rachel: Ok professor or detective? Phoebe: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us? Rachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory! Phoebe: And that horrible museum tour! Ross: No, I arranged that... (Joey enters, wearing a bathrobe)Joey: (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun. Phoebe: We know about your party Joey. Joey: What party? Monica: The game's over! Take off your robe! Joey: (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean... Everyone: No!! Cover it up!! Joey: (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves) [Scene: The Roof] Joey: (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming. Monica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder! Kyle Lowder: (to Monica) Hi. (walks on) Monica: (Yells after him) I love you! Joey: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something... Monica: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered. Phoebe: Hey! Monica: (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself. Phoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around) Monica: (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler! [Scene: The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously] Chandler: Where the hell is everybody? (The lights dim and Chandler tries to get away but as the bitter lady comes on stage and starts yelling he promptly changes his mind and sits down)Bitter lady: (yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period. [Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it] Monica: (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love". Rachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number. Monica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married! Matthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel. Rachel: Nice to meet you. Matthew Ashford: Call me. Rachel: Ok (Matthew leaves)Monica: (yelling after him) We will!! Monica: (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys! Rachel: Yeah! Monica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey? Rachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler! Monica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather) (cut to Ross and Charlie)Ross: (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh? Charlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone. Ross: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer? Charlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with. Ross: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer? Charlie: Yeah... Ross: ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby... Charlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man. Ross: Eh, you think?

Rachel: Ok (Matthew leaves)Monica: (yelling after him) We will!! Monica: (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys! Rachel: Yeah! Monica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey? Rachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler! Monica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather) (cut to Ross and Charlie)Ross: (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh? Charlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone. Ross: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer? Charlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with. Ross: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer? Charlie: Yeah... Ross: ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby... Charlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man. Ross: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10! Charlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues... Ross: (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood". Charlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him. Ross: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: A guy who won two. Ross: (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart Charlie: Yeah... for three years. Ross: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy. Ross: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him? Charlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant. Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter) Phoebe: Hey Ross! Rache: How is it going with Charlie? Ross: (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out. Phoebe: Oh, What's the matter? Ross: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth. Rachel: I always loved that!! Ross: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God! Phoebe: Worse? Ross: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that? Phoebe: (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks) Ross: What? (turns around to look at Rachel) Rachel: Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves) [Scene: Chandler in the theater] Bitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh? Chandler: (To himself) oh yes, God yes!! Bitter lady: (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!?! Chandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely. [Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy] Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands) Ross: Nice to meet you. Dirk: Hey! So what show are you on? Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. (Dirk is confused)Joey: It's a science. Dirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize. (Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys. Dirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs. Ross: I'd lead with that. (Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so). Joey: Monica! Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! (Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)Joey: (To Rachel) What have you got there? Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers. Joey: Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty? Rachel: (drunken voice) I think I am. Joey: (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. (Rachel is puzzled)Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys? Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet. Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. Rachel: Who (looks around)? (Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)Joey: Me. Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really? Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five) Joey: Gotcha. Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey. (Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)(Chandler walks in)Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play? Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry. Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater. Monica: You really liked it? Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted. Monica: Oh really! Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period! Monica: No! Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra? Monica: So I got it when I was 13... [Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.] Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize. Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd. Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited. Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... Ross: And sexy. Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her. Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)! (Rachel approaches Monica)Rachel: (to Monica) Hey! Monica: Hey! Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea. Rachel: Please, what about you and Chandler? Monica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid! Rachel: Well hello (points to herself)! Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them? Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it. Monica: And I can't stop you. Rachel: No. (Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)Ross: (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? (Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)Ross: I'm smarter than him! Closing credits[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line] Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you. Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful. Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period. Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away). 
(The lights dim and Chandler tries to get away but as the bitter lady comes on stage and starts yelling he promptly changes his mind and sits down)Bitter lady: (yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period. [Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it] Monica: (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love". Rachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number. Monica: Oh man!

(Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood". Charlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him. Ross: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: A guy who won two. Ross: (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart Charlie: Yeah... for three years. Ross: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize? Charlie: (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy. Ross: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him? Charlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant. Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter) Phoebe: Hey Ross! Rache: How is it going with Charlie? Ross: (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out. Phoebe: Oh, What's the matter? Ross: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth. Rachel: I always loved that!! Ross: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God! Phoebe: Worse? Ross: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that? Phoebe: (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks) Ross: What? (turns around to look at Rachel) Rachel: Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves) [Scene: Chandler in the theater] Bitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh? Chandler: (To himself) oh yes, God yes!! Bitter lady: (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!?! Chandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely. [Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy] Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands) Ross: Nice to meet you. Dirk: Hey! So what show are you on? Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. (Dirk is confused)Joey: It's a science. Dirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize. (Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys. Dirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs. Ross: I'd lead with that. (Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so). Joey: Monica! Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! (Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)Joey: (To Rachel) What have you got there? Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers. Joey: Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty? Rachel: (drunken voice) I think I am. Joey: (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. (Rachel is puzzled)Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys? Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet. Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. Rachel: Who (looks around)? (Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)Joey: Me. Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really? Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five) Joey: Gotcha. Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey. (Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)(Chandler walks in)Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play? Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry. Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater. Monica: You really liked it? Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted. Monica: Oh really! Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period! Monica: No! Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra? Monica: So I got it when I was 13... [Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.] Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize. Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd. Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited. Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... Ross: And sexy. Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her. Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)! (Rachel approaches Monica)Rachel: (to Monica) Hey! Monica: Hey! Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea. Rachel: Please, what about you and Chandler? Monica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid! Rachel: Well hello (points to herself)! Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them? Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it. Monica: And I can't stop you. Rachel: No. (Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)Ross: (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? (Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)Ross: I'm smarter than him! Closing credits[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line] Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you. Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful. Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period. Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away). 
Ross: (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Ross: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Ross: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Ross: ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...

Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you. Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful. Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period. Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away). 
Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
(Rachel is puzzled)Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys? Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet. Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. Rachel: Who (looks around)? (Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)Joey: Me. Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really? Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five) Joey: Gotcha. Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey. (Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)(Chandler walks in)Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play? Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry. Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater. Monica: You really liked it? Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted. Monica: Oh really! Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period! Monica: No! Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra? Monica: So I got it when I was 13... [Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.] Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize. Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd. Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited. Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... Ross: And sexy. Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her. Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)! (Rachel approaches Monica)Rachel: (to Monica) Hey! Monica: Hey! Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them? Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it. Monica: And I can't stop you. Rachel: No. (Rachel goes look for Joey.

Ross: I'm smarter than him!
Ross: Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Ross: Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did    not kiss.
Ross: Why do you care so much?
Ross: Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each    other's tonsils...
Ross: Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with    it...
(Joey and Charlie enter. Ross looks at her)    Ross: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was! Joey: Hey! All: Hi! Ross: I'm gonna get some more coffee. Charlie: Oh, you know what? I'll come with you! Ross: Ok. (they both go) Chandler: (to Joey) So, a professor, uh? Joey: Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious    (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not    how she used it...? Charlie: (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't    ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed.    I really hope you don't think less of me. Ross: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like    someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people. Charlie: You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean,    Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors,    and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you    know, very cerebral... Ross: Yeah, I know the type. Joey: Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.    No? Am I getting close? Opening credits [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment] Phoebe: (entering) Hey! Monica: Hey! Phoebe: Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of    slippers) Rachel: Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them? Phoebe: I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania    Twain. Rachel: (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive! Phoebe: Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom) Monica: Hey, what's this? Rachel: Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO. Monica: Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage    chains. Rachel: Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things    that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting... Monica: Do you wanna go hunting? Rachel: Well, I would like to have the option!! Phoebe: (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift    certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!! Rachel: Oh! Phoebe: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big    massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business! Monica: And she wants to go hunting, too!! Rachel: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks! Phoebe: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's    about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells. Rachel: I don't care about any of that!! Phoebe: Well, do you care about friendship? Rachel: Oh! Phoebe: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use    this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend. Rachel: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it! Phoebe: Promise? Rachel: I promise. Phoebe: Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate) Rachel: But I am going hunting!! [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment] Monica: (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today! Chandler: Oh, yeah? Monica: Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight? Chandler: Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the    table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it) Monica: Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience!    Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank. Chandler: We really need to take those tests? Monica: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests. Chandler: But I don't wanna do it in a cup! Monica: What is the big deal? Chandler: It's weird! In a doctor's office? Monica: It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell? Chandler: (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause)    And in my defense, it was a Wendy's! Monica: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea! Chandler: Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory! Monica: (really embarrassed) OH! Chandler: Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO! [Scene: Joey's apartment] Joey: (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost    more than milk! (somebody knocks the door, Joey opens and it's Charlie)  Joey: Heeey! Charlie: Hi! Joey: Come on in, how are ya? Charlie: I'm good! Joey: Can I offer you a drink? Charlie: Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with    the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword    for a friend's book... Joey: Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to    open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh! Charlie: So I am just so excited to be    here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city! Joey: Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself) Charlie: Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun! Joey: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first? Charlie: Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher    Hall. Joey: (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok! Charlie: And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display    at the public library. Joey: I know, yeah! Charlie: And first, I have to see the MET! Joey: Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna    see the Yankees. Charlie: No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular! Joey: Which one, they all suck! Charlie: The museum! Joey: (looking puzzled) I don't think so. [Scene: SPA massage center, Rachel enters] Rachel: (to the receptionist) Hi there! Receptionist: (in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa    SPA. How may I help you? Rachel: Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and    here is my gift certificate. Receptionist: This has been torn up. Rachel: And... taped back together. Receptionist: Ok well, I'll call you as    soon as your massage therapist is ready. Rachel: Ok Receptionist: Have a seat through the glass doors. Rachel: (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors. Receptionist: Through the glass doors. Rachel: Alright-y then. (Phoebe enters the hall)  Receptionist: Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room. Phoebe: Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She    sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone    who can fill in for me? Receptionist: Sorry, everyone is booked! Phoebe: But that woman can't know I work    here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are. Receptionist: Then why you work here? Phoebe: 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine! Receptionist: Well, I think this is a great place to work! Phoebe: (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening? [Scene: Central Perk] (Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa)  Joey: Ross! Ross: Hi! Joey: I need to talk to you about Charlie. Ross: (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really? Joey: Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem. Ross: Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"    means, just don't use it! Joey: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo... Ross: Get to the problem! Joey: Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid! Ross: (looking down) Are you wearing two belts? Joey: (checking) EH, what do you know! Ross: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid. Joey: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out! Ross: You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship. Joey: Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her. Ross: (after a short hesitation) Fine. Joey: Thanks. Ross: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET! Joey: The Metsss! Ross: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Joey: (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion! Ross: Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans! Joey: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. Ross: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love. Joey: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! Ross: But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food... Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too    fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok? Ross: Ok. Joey: You got to tell me exactly what to do there. Ross: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire. Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the    right and Joey nods) [Scene: doctor's waiting room] Chandler: I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet. Monica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that. (a nurse walks in) Nurse: Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container. Chandler: Deposit my specimen? You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk. Thanks, got it. Monica: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok? Chandler: Yeah, I guess! Monica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even    knows you! Janice: OH MY GOD!! Chandler: Oh, Come on! Commercial Break Janice: Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this! Monica: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home! Chandler: Why are you here? Janice: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we... Chandler: (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is    she here?? Janice: Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz    they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking    at the cup in his hand). Chandler: What!? (Janice does her "Janice Laugh")  Monica: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!    (leaves) Chandler: I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got    a hot date... (starts to leave) Janice: Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you    need a hand! Chandler: (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves) [Scene: At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door] Phoebe: (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time    for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole. Rachel: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her    head in the hole and Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Okay, then I'm Swedish... Monica: So, what's your name? Phoebe: It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea... Rachel: Oh... what an interesting name. Phoebe: Ja! Rachel: You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's    direction) Phoebe: (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage! Rachel: (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love    your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers) Phoebe: Is something wrong? Rachel: No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause)    Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden? Phoebe: (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm. Rachel: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right! [Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room,    rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum] Joey: (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself. Ross: Now, do you have any idea what you just said? Joey: (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! Ross: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you. Joey: Phonetically? (Looks confused) Ross: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this. Joey: Ok. Ross: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly! Joey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". Ross: Wow. What does that mean? Joey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". Ross: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance? Joey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the    imaginary painting). Ross: Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings. Joey: Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again) Ross: No! (Slaps his hand) [Scene: The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms] Chandler: (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.    Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees    Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone? Janice: Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit? Chandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over! Janice: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results? Chandler: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. Janice: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is. Chandler: (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby? Janice: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine. Chandler: (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe    I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'... Janice: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office? Chandler: (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!!    " [Scene: Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging    Rachel] Phoebe: (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is    the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed) Rachel: Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have    a friend who is a masseuse. Phoebe: Oh, Ja! Ja! Rachel: Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated) Phoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is? Rachel: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar... Phoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're    such a high maintenance tight ass! Rachel: (now lifts her head) Phoebe!! Phoebe: You know it's me? Rachel: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden! Phoebe: How can you come here? Rachel: How could you not tell me you worked here? Phoebe: I don't have to tell you everything! Rachel: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage! Phoebe: Tips not included. Rachel: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here? Phoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...    you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!    paying taxes! Rachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles    and I so admire that! I don't have any! Phoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time    I took my life back! Rachel: Good for you Pheebs! Phoebe: Ok. Phoebe: Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and    whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any    of that. I love you. [Scene: Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on    his laptop] Ross: Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die! (Charlie walks in.)  Ross: (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor    R. Geller. (hits &lt;return&gt;, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the    sofa) Hey! Charlie: Hi! Ross: Hey, how was the Met? Charlie: The museum was amazing! Ross: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh? Charlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. Ross: What do you mean? Charlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around. Ross: (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the Met, did you go to the right? Charlie: No, we went to the left. Ross: (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together. Charlie: Yeah, it's fun (hesitating). Ross: What? Charlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really    know me that well; it would be weird. Ross: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on. Charlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common    with. You know what I mean? Ross: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey    a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else. Charlie: Yeah, I guess that's true. Ross: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You    know, that's the kind of guy Joey is. Charlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot! Ross: That was going to be my next argument. (Joey walks in)  Joey: Hey! Ross: Hey! Charlie: Hey! Joey: (to Charlie) You're ready? Charlie: Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks    Ross. Joey: (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up. Ross: Glad I could help man. Joey: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but... (confidently) I made it work. [Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa,    reading the newspaper.] Chandler: (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited    his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now. (phone rings)  Chandler: Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here    but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile    fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause)    Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up) (Monica walks in)  Monica: Hey sweetie. Chandler: Doctor Connelly just called. Monica: With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course    it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called".    If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just    called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem    with me or with you? Chandler: Actually it's both of us. Monica: What? Chandler: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment. Monica: Oh... what does that mean? Chandler: It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It    means... Monica: Chandler? Chandler: (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us. Monica: (weeping) Oh my God! Chandler: I'm sorry. Monica: I'm sorry too. (they hug)  Chandler: Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out. Monica: (still weeping) I know. Closing credits [Scene: The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in] Receptionist: Good morning Phoebe. Phoebe: (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist. Receptionist: Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is    in room No. 1. Phoebe: Rachel Green?

Put your face in the hole, lassy. End 
Ross: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Ross: I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Ross: Ok. (they both go)
Ross: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like    someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Ross: Yeah, I know the type.
(somebody knocks the door, Joey opens and it's Charlie)  Joey: Heeey! Charlie: Hi! Joey: Come on in, how are ya? Charlie: I'm good! Joey: Can I offer you a drink? Charlie: Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with    the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword    for a friend's book... Joey: Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to    open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh! Charlie: So I am just so excited to be    here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city! Joey: Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself) Charlie: Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun! Joey: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first? Charlie: Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher    Hall. Joey: (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok! Charlie: And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display    at the public library. Joey: I know, yeah! Charlie: And first, I have to see the MET! Joey: Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna    see the Yankees. Charlie: No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular! Joey: Which one, they all suck! Charlie: The museum! Joey: (looking puzzled) I don't think so. [Scene: SPA massage center, Rachel enters] Rachel: (to the receptionist) Hi there! Receptionist: (in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa    SPA. How may I help you? Rachel: Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and    here is my gift certificate. Receptionist: This has been torn up. Rachel: And... taped back together. Receptionist: Ok well, I'll call you as    soon as your massage therapist is ready. Rachel: Ok Receptionist: Have a seat through the glass doors. Rachel: (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors. Receptionist: Through the glass doors. Rachel: Alright-y then. (Phoebe enters the hall)  Receptionist: Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room. Phoebe: Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She    sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone    who can fill in for me? Receptionist: Sorry, everyone is booked! Phoebe: But that woman can't know I work    here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are. Receptionist: Then why you work here? Phoebe: 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine! Receptionist: Well, I think this is a great place to work! Phoebe: (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening? [Scene: Central Perk] (Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa)  Joey: Ross! Ross: Hi! Joey: I need to talk to you about Charlie. Ross: (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really? Joey: Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem. Ross: Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"    means, just don't use it! Joey: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo... Ross: Get to the problem! Joey: Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid! Ross: (looking down) Are you wearing two belts? Joey: (checking) EH, what do you know! Ross: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid. Joey: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out! Ross: You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship. Joey: Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her. Ross: (after a short hesitation) Fine. Joey: Thanks. Ross: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET! Joey: The Metsss! Ross: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Joey: (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion! Ross: Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans! Joey: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. Ross: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love. Joey: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! Ross: But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food... Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too    fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok? Ross: Ok. Joey: You got to tell me exactly what to do there. Ross: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire. Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the    right and Joey nods) [Scene: doctor's waiting room] Chandler: I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet. Monica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that. (a nurse walks in) Nurse: Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container. Chandler: Deposit my specimen? You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk. Thanks, got it. Monica: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok? Chandler: Yeah, I guess! Monica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even    knows you! Janice: OH MY GOD!! Chandler: Oh, Come on! Commercial Break Janice: Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this! Monica: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home! Chandler: Why are you here? Janice: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we... Chandler: (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is    she here?? Janice: Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz    they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking    at the cup in his hand). Chandler: What!?

She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are. Receptionist: Then why you work here? Phoebe: 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine! Receptionist: Well, I think this is a great place to work! Phoebe: (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening? [Scene: Central Perk] (Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa)  Joey: Ross! Ross: Hi! Joey: I need to talk to you about Charlie. Ross: (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really? Joey: Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem. Ross: Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"    means, just don't use it! Joey: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo... Ross: Get to the problem! Joey: Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid! Ross: (looking down) Are you wearing two belts? Joey: (checking) EH, what do you know! Ross: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid. Joey: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out! Ross: You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship. Joey: Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her. Ross: (after a short hesitation) Fine. Joey: Thanks. Ross: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET! Joey: The Metsss! Ross: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Joey: (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion! Ross: Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans! Joey: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. Ross: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love. Joey: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! Ross: But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food... Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too    fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok? Ross: Ok. Joey: You got to tell me exactly what to do there. Ross: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire. Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the    right and Joey nods) [Scene: doctor's waiting room] Chandler: I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet. Monica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that. (a nurse walks in) Nurse: Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container. Chandler: Deposit my specimen? You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk. Thanks, got it. Monica: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok? Chandler: Yeah, I guess! Monica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even    knows you! Janice: OH MY GOD!! Chandler: Oh, Come on! Commercial Break Janice: Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this! Monica: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home! Chandler: Why are you here? Janice: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we... Chandler: (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is    she here?? Janice: Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz    they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking    at the cup in his hand). Chandler: What!? (Janice does her "Janice Laugh")  Monica: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!    (leaves) Chandler: I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got    a hot date... (starts to leave) Janice: Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you    need a hand! Chandler: (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves) [Scene: At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door] Phoebe: (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time    for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole. Rachel: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her    head in the hole and Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Okay, then I'm Swedish... Monica: So, what's your name? Phoebe: It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea... Rachel: Oh... what an interesting name. Phoebe: Ja! Rachel: You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's    direction) Phoebe: (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage! Rachel: (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love    your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers) Phoebe: Is something wrong? Rachel: No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause)    Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden? Phoebe: (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm. Rachel: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right! [Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room,    rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum] Joey: (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself. Ross: Now, do you have any idea what you just said? Joey: (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! Ross: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you. Joey: Phonetically? (Looks confused) Ross: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this. Joey: Ok. Ross: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly! Joey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". Ross: Wow. What does that mean? Joey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". Ross: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance? Joey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the    imaginary painting). Ross: Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings. Joey: Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again) Ross: No! (Slaps his hand) [Scene: The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms] Chandler: (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.    Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees    Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone? Janice: Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit? Chandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over! Janice: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results? Chandler: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. Janice: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is. Chandler: (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby? Janice: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine. Chandler: (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe    I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'... Janice: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office? Chandler: (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!!    " [Scene: Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging    Rachel] Phoebe: (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is    the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed) Rachel: Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have    a friend who is a masseuse. Phoebe: Oh, Ja! Ja! Rachel: Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated) Phoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is? Rachel: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar... Phoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're    such a high maintenance tight ass! Rachel: (now lifts her head) Phoebe!! Phoebe: You know it's me? Rachel: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden! Phoebe: How can you come here? Rachel: How could you not tell me you worked here? Phoebe: I don't have to tell you everything! Rachel: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage! Phoebe: Tips not included. Rachel: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here? Phoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...    you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!    paying taxes! Rachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles    and I so admire that! I don't have any! Phoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time    I took my life back! Rachel: Good for you Pheebs! Phoebe: Ok. Phoebe: Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and    whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any    of that. I love you. [Scene: Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on    his laptop] Ross: Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die! (Charlie walks in.)  Ross: (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor    R. Geller. (hits &lt;return&gt;, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the    sofa) Hey! Charlie: Hi! Ross: Hey, how was the Met? Charlie: The museum was amazing! Ross: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh? Charlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. Ross: What do you mean? Charlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around. Ross: (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the Met, did you go to the right? Charlie: No, we went to the left. Ross: (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together. Charlie: Yeah, it's fun (hesitating). Ross: What? Charlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really    know me that well; it would be weird. Ross: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on. Charlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common    with. You know what I mean? Ross: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey    a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else. Charlie: Yeah, I guess that's true. Ross: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You    know, that's the kind of guy Joey is. Charlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot! Ross: That was going to be my next argument. (Joey walks in)  Joey: Hey! Ross: Hey! Charlie: Hey! Joey: (to Charlie) You're ready? Charlie: Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks    Ross. Joey: (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up. Ross: Glad I could help man. Joey: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but... (confidently) I made it work. [Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa,    reading the newspaper.] Chandler: (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited    his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now. (phone rings)  Chandler: Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here    but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile    fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause)    Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up) (Monica walks in)  Monica: Hey sweetie. Chandler: Doctor Connelly just called. Monica: With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course    it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called".    If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just    called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem    with me or with you? Chandler: Actually it's both of us. Monica: What? Chandler: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment. Monica: Oh... what does that mean? Chandler: It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It    means... Monica: Chandler? Chandler: (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us. Monica: (weeping) Oh my God! Chandler: I'm sorry. Monica: I'm sorry too. (they hug)  Chandler: Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out. Monica: (still weeping) I know. Closing credits [Scene: The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in] Receptionist: Good morning Phoebe. Phoebe: (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist. Receptionist: Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is    in room No. 1. Phoebe: Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back? (Phoebe walks to the door and half-opens it)  Phoebe: (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for    your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy. End

(very quickly and wringing hands) Of course    it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called".    If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just    called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem    with me or with you? Chandler: Actually it's both of us. Monica: What? Chandler: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment. Monica: Oh... what does that mean? Chandler: It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It    means... Monica: Chandler? Chandler: (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us. Monica: (weeping) Oh my God! Chandler: I'm sorry. Monica: I'm sorry too. (they hug)  Chandler: Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out. Monica: (still weeping) I know. Closing credits [Scene: The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in] Receptionist: Good morning Phoebe. Phoebe: (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist. Receptionist: Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is    in room No. 1. Phoebe: Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back? (Phoebe walks to the door and half-opens it)  Phoebe: (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for    your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy. End 
Ross: Hi!
Ross: (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?
Ross: Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"    means, just don't use it!
Ross: Get to the problem!
Ross: (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
Ross: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Ross: You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship.
Ross: (after a short hesitation) Fine.
Ross: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Ross: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Ross: Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!
Ross: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love.
Ross: But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
Ross: Ok.
Ross: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
(Janice does her "Janice Laugh")  Monica: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!    (leaves) Chandler: I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got    a hot date... (starts to leave) Janice: Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you    need a hand! Chandler: (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves) [Scene: At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door] Phoebe: (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time    for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole. Rachel: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her    head in the hole and Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Okay, then I'm Swedish... Monica: So, what's your name? Phoebe: It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea... Rachel: Oh... what an interesting name. Phoebe: Ja! Rachel: You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's    direction) Phoebe: (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage! Rachel: (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love    your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers) Phoebe: Is something wrong? Rachel: No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause)    Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden? Phoebe: (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm. Rachel: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right! [Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room,    rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum] Joey: (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself. Ross: Now, do you have any idea what you just said? Joey: (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! Ross: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you. Joey: Phonetically? (Looks confused) Ross: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this. Joey: Ok. Ross: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly! Joey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy". Ross: Wow. What does that mean? Joey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear". Ross: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance? Joey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the    imaginary painting). Ross: Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings. Joey: Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again) Ross: No! (Slaps his hand) [Scene: The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms] Chandler: (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.    Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees    Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone? Janice: Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit? Chandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over! Janice: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results? Chandler: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. Janice: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is. Chandler: (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby? Janice: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine. Chandler: (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe    I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'... Janice: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office? Chandler: (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!!    " [Scene: Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging    Rachel] Phoebe: (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is    the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed) Rachel: Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have    a friend who is a masseuse. Phoebe: Oh, Ja! Ja! Rachel: Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated) Phoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is? Rachel: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar... Phoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're    such a high maintenance tight ass! Rachel: (now lifts her head) Phoebe!! Phoebe: You know it's me? Rachel: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden! Phoebe: How can you come here? Rachel: How could you not tell me you worked here? Phoebe: I don't have to tell you everything! Rachel: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage! Phoebe: Tips not included. Rachel: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here? Phoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...    you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!    paying taxes! Rachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles    and I so admire that! I don't have any! Phoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time    I took my life back! Rachel: Good for you Pheebs! Phoebe: Ok. Phoebe: Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and    whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any    of that. I love you. [Scene: Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on    his laptop] Ross: Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die! (Charlie walks in.)  Ross: (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor    R. Geller. (hits &lt;return&gt;, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the    sofa) Hey! Charlie: Hi! Ross: Hey, how was the Met? Charlie: The museum was amazing! Ross: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh? Charlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. Ross: What do you mean? Charlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around. Ross: (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the Met, did you go to the right? Charlie: No, we went to the left. Ross: (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together. Charlie: Yeah, it's fun (hesitating). Ross: What? Charlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really    know me that well; it would be weird. Ross: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on. Charlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common    with. You know what I mean? Ross: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey    a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else. Charlie: Yeah, I guess that's true. Ross: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You    know, that's the kind of guy Joey is. Charlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot! Ross: That was going to be my next argument. (Joey walks in)  Joey: Hey! Ross: Hey! Charlie: Hey! Joey: (to Charlie) You're ready? Charlie: Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks    Ross. Joey: (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up. Ross: Glad I could help man. Joey: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but... (confidently) I made it work. [Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa,    reading the newspaper.] Chandler: (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited    his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.

Ross: Hey!
Ross: Glad I could help man.
Ross: (entering) Hey, you guys!
Ross: Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Ross: Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?
Ross: Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Ross: Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Ross: Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
Ross: Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Ross: It's in Barbados.
Ross: So-so what did the doctor say?
Ross: How do you feel about all this?
Ross: (puzzled) What?
Ross: (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Ross: The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Ross: (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
Ross: Oh, that's not what you want...
Ross: Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Ross: I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Ross: It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Ross: Barbados.
Ross: What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Ross: I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Ross: (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
Ross: Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Ross: (to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
Ross: Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Ross: Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Ross: Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Ross: It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Ross: (very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
Ross: Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
Ross: Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..." (he takes the notepad)
Ross: "... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Ross: Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Ross: Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
Ross: Hey!
Ross: (Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Ross: Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Ross: Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Ross: (to Charlie) Ready to go?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: (a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
Ross: Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
Ross: By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Ross: Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).
Ross: The chocolates aren't here yet.
Ross: If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
Ross: Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
Ross: What, oh my God. What did you do?
Ross: Why, why would you open it?
Ross: What did it say?
Ross: What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
Ross: NO! I don't!!
Ross: Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Ross: Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Ross: Get out! (Chandler runs out)
Ross: Well, what do you do?
Ross: I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Ross: I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Ross: Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Ross: Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Ross: Yeah, that's it?
Ross: Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
Ross: Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace.
Ross: Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
Ross: Oh my God, I love you.
Ross: That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: No. (they clink glasses and drink)
Ross: (embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Ross: Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Ross: Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
Ross: My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Ross: I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
Ross: And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Ross: (embarassed) Me neither.
Ross: Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
Ross: Good night.
Ross: (from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!
Ross: Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Ross: Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
Ross: And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Ross: But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
Ross: ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Ross: (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
Ross: Oh, thanks guys!
Ross: Oh!
Ross: (with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
Ross: Oh, thank you so much!
Ross: (puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Ross: (skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Ross: Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
Ross: No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Ross: (joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Ross: (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!
Ross: Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)
Ross: Get Out!
Ross: Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?
Ross: Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Ross: I knew that was him!
Ross: (holding her hand) Hey, you ok?
Ross: Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Ross: (standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Ross: I don't think they saw us.
Ross: (apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Ross: I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
Ross: I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Ross: I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)

Chandler: Really? Like you have a routine? Joey: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have   to appreciate their uniqueness. Chandler: Really? Joey: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.   Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh. Chandler: You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh   in a funny and awkard way) Joey: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts   lightly grazing Chandler's thigh) Chandler: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They   look at each other, both embarassed) Joey: More foosball? Chandler: ...and beer!!

Chandler: She went on one of those spray-on tan places. Ross: Eh, you got a spray-on tan? Monica: Chandler gets pedicures! Ross: (laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators? Chandler: (To Monica) Why...why? Ross: Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,   it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one! Chandler: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can   really show it off. Ross: So, do you get colours or just French tips? Monica: There. Here's their card. Ross: Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this   place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he   is saying) florist. (he goes away) (Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Hey! Chandler: Hey Pheebs! Monica: Hey Phoebe! Phoebe: Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town. Monica: I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me   too! She's the worst! Chandler: Who's Amanda? Monica: She's this girl who used to live   in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up   this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda   using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!" Chandler: Are you trying to do a British accent? Monica: (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets   pedicures! Chandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect? Phoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on   the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) "Oh, so sorry to catch you   on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call   me on my mo-Bile!" Monica: I know, and she's always bragging   about all the famous people she's met. Phoebe: Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel".   All right, who hasn't? Monica: Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't   wanna see her!! Phoebe: Ugh, Let's just cut her out! Monica: What? Phoebe: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and   dodge her 'till she gets the point! Monica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but...   it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that? Chandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !  [Scene: At the tanning salon. Ross and a male assistant are   walking through a hall] Assistant: Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three. Ross: Well... I like how you look, what are you? Assistant: Puerto Rican. Ross: Two, I think a two. Assistant: You've got to face the red light.   When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.   When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks   then turn around so we can get your back. Got it? Ross: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat. Assistant: Wow, you catch on quick. Ross: Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not   impressed by this statement)   (Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up   in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso) Ross: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer   starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've   not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room) Ross: You sprayed my front twice! Assistant: You've never turned?  Ross: No, I barely even   got to three Mississippi.  Assistant: Mississippi? I said count to   five'! Ross: Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how   bad is it? Assistant: Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps   getting darker for the next four hours. Ross: So, how dark is it   gonna get? Assistant: You got sprayed with two two'   s and... Ross: I'm a four? Assistant: Yeah, but you're back's a zero.   You're gonna wanna even that out. Ross: (sarcastically) Really! Assistant: You might wanna get back in there. Ross: (annoyed) Ok! (The assistant leaves and Ross goes back in the spray-on tan booth and turns   his back to the spray nozzles, facing the back wall) Ross: Wait, wait a minute, there's no light   on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns   and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns   again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out   of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing   happened again! Assistant: You got two more twos? Ross: (hysterically) I'm an eight! [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Joey and Rachel enter the room] Rachel: Thanks for dinner. Joey: I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems   puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there! Rachel: So. Joey: Yeah. (Joey and Rachel start kissing) Joey: Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of   the couch? Rachel: I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok. (They move on the couch and start kissing again. Joey does his grazing on   Rachel’s thigh and she slaps his hand) Joey: What’s the matter? Rachel: I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t   know why I did that! Joey and Rachel: Okay Rachel: Ok, so sorry. (They start kissing again and, when Joey grazes her thigh, she slaps him on   his hand again) Rachel: I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t   know what happened, I must be nervous! Joey: I don’t get it, Chandler loved it! Rachel: Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t   do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great. Joey: Ok. (They start kissing again and when Joey grazes, she slaps him three times,   on the hand, and on both cheeks) Joey: (a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you? [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Monica and Phoebe are reading   magazines when the phone rings and Phoebe reaches to pick it up] Monica: (to Phoebe) No, no, don’t get it. Let the machine pick up. Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could   baby-sit again. Monica: It could be Amanda! Phoebe: Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about   Rachel. Babysitting is a gas! (The machine picks up the phone) Amanda: Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. I   am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat! Monica: You're from Yonkers! Your last name   is Buffo-Martisis! Amanda: Let’s see.. to assure you get this directly,   ring me back on my mobile. Phoebe: Ok, don’t hold thy breath! (Sound of dialing numbers is heard from the speaker of the machine) Chandler: Hello? Is someone on the line? Amanda: Yes, I was looking for Monica. Chandler: Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the   living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya. Monica: We weren’t picking up, it’s   Amanda! Chandler: (to Amanda) I get pedicures! Monica: Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s...   is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe   and I will see you then! Phoebe: Why, why, why didn’t you just say no! Monica: Well, I said 'no' to her coming   over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to   please people! Phoebe: (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well   under torture! Monica: And you would? Phoebe: I did! [scene: Joey’s apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting   on the couch] Joey: Rach, you sure you wanna do this? Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a   little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some   getting used to. Joey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier? Rachel: Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods,   but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe! Joey: Ok, yeah, got it. Rachel and Joey: Okay. (They start kissing and Joey starts to undo her bra, but fails completely) Joey: This thing welded shut?! Rachel: Okay. Joey: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this   thing. Rachel: Oh! (Joey starts trying to undo her bra, but it won’t go.The elastic band   snaps back, hurting Rachel.) Rachel: Ow! Joey: Sorry! Rachel: Well this is romantic! Joey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me   before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can   do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!   I blame your bra! Rachel: It’s a standard issue bra clasp! Joey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me   off with all your slapping! Rachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,   but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take   off my bra? Joey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said)   NAH! I don't have another level!!  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment] (Chandler is at the table reading; Monica puts some food for him on the table. Ross walks in looking very tanned. Chandler and Monica look up at him smiling.)  Chandler: Hold on! There is something different. Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested. Chandler: Was that place... The Sun? Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler   and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,   where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.) Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself! Monica: How could you mess this up? It's   so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!! Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five? Monica: One Two Three... Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel   just enters, sees him and starts laughing) Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh! Ross: (Still yelling) I Know! Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic? Chandler: How was your date with Joey? Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away! Chandler: You didn't like that? Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out   too! He couldn't even undo my bra! Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open. (Chandler starts looking at her bra) Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me. Monica: Well, you guys have been friends   forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?   You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that. Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,   we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna   power through! (Joey walks in) Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points   to the hall). Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through   (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment). (Chandler resumes staring at Monica's bra) Monica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler,   stop! It is not going to pop open! Chandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't   know! (Monica just smiles) [Scene: Central Perk.] (Phoebe is sitting on the couch. Monica walks in.) Monica: Hey Phoebe! Phoebe: Hey! Monica: Is Amanda here yet? Phoebe: No. Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look   I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.   Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency. Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here? Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident? Phoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it! (A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda) Phoebe: Hi! Monica: Hi! Amanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug) Amanda: (To Monica) Hello! (Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda   hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.) Amanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you!   Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as   well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch   my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places   them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to   sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married! Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is   Chandler and... Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's   not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent! (Monica looks shocked) Phoebe: Musty! Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like   old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again! Monica: When were we not friends? Amanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was   the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly). Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992. Amanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging   her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.  Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut   me out? Phoebe: Well...kinda. Monica: Oh My God! Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like   a perfect arse! Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass". (Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.) Monica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,   what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)   Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up) Phoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my   God. Was Mike with him? Monica: Nope! (She turns and leaves) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.] (Joey comes running in.) Joey: (To Rachel) Hey! Rachel: Hey! Got champagne? Joey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through! Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone   is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove   her bra from under her clothes)... Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)  Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very   sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!   Lets do it! Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit. Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She   pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like   that huh? Joey: Oh! yeah! Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,   putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She   pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between   his legs and begins to kiss his neck.) Joey: uh uh! Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it! Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters! Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok? Joey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with   a painful look on his face) Soldier down! [Monica and Chandlers apartment.] (Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.) Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore. Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok! (Phoebe and Amanda walk in) Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute? Monica: I have nothing to say to   you. Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,   my flat is twice this size! Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall? (They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.) Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly. Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat. [Scene: The hallway] Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why? Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill. Monica: I'm still all those things! Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy! Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy. Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in. Monica: It's because I'm scrappy. Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you. Monica: I won't know what I would do without   you. (They hug) Monica: Well, I guess we should go back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda. Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right. (They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for   Chandler, but she's really terrible at it) Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional   dance training. (Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again) [Scene: A different spray-on tan center] (Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.) Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the   booth, and... Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does   it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back. Glenda: (quietly) Okay... (Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands   with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles   at both sides of the wall) Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it? (He turns around frantically from side to side.) Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it? (He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in   this face and front again.) Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH! (He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's] (Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other) Rachel: What is the matter with us? Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me. Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult? Joey: I don't know. (Chandler enters the apartment) Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey! Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that? Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys... Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally... Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong? Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time. (Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get   to them) Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the   joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs) Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us. Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit. Rachel: Right, totally. Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it. Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex. Joey: That's a... pla-an. (They both stare for a while, and then look at each other) Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming. Rachel: I know.  Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted.  Rachel: Hmmm... Me too... (She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.) Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it? Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are. (Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder) Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right. (They look at each other for a while) Joey: So... Rachel: Yeah. Joey: I love ya. Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed. Joey: Yeah, me too. (Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.) Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while. (Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on   his sore spot)  ENDING CREDITS  [Scene: Ross's apartment.] (Ross is reading a National Geographic on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the door.) Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. (Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.) Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody. Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in. Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily? (Ross walks to the door and opens it.) Ross: Dude, you're not tanned. Chandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this. (Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.) Chandler: I see you later! (Ross closes the door)  end    
Ross: (looking at Monica's legs) WOW!
Ross: I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Ross: Eh, you got a spray-on tan?

Ross: Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,   it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!

(Sound of dialing numbers is heard from the speaker of the machine) Chandler: Hello? Is someone on the line? Amanda: Yes, I was looking for Monica. Chandler: Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the   living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya. Monica: We weren’t picking up, it’s   Amanda! Chandler: (to Amanda) I get pedicures! Monica: Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s...   is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe   and I will see you then! Phoebe: Why, why, why didn’t you just say no! Monica: Well, I said 'no' to her coming   over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to   please people! Phoebe: (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well   under torture! Monica: And you would? Phoebe: I did! [scene: Joey’s apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting   on the couch] Joey: Rach, you sure you wanna do this? Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a   little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some   getting used to. Joey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier? Rachel: Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods,   but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe! Joey: Ok, yeah, got it. Rachel and Joey: Okay. (They start kissing and Joey starts to undo her bra, but fails completely) Joey: This thing welded shut?! Rachel: Okay. Joey: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this   thing. Rachel: Oh! (Joey starts trying to undo her bra, but it won’t go.The elastic band   snaps back, hurting Rachel.) Rachel: Ow! Joey: Sorry! Rachel: Well this is romantic! Joey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me   before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can   do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!   I blame your bra! Rachel: It’s a standard issue bra clasp! Joey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me   off with all your slapping! Rachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,   but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take   off my bra? Joey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said)   NAH! I don't have another level!!  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment] (Chandler is at the table reading; Monica puts some food for him on the table. Ross walks in looking very tanned. Chandler and Monica look up at him smiling.)  Chandler: Hold on! There is something different. Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested. Chandler: Was that place... The Sun? Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler   and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,   where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.) Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself! Monica: How could you mess this up? It's   so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!! Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five? Monica: One Two Three... Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel   just enters, sees him and starts laughing) Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh! Ross: (Still yelling) I Know! Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic? Chandler: How was your date with Joey? Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away! Chandler: You didn't like that? Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out   too! He couldn't even undo my bra! Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open. (Chandler starts looking at her bra) Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me. Monica: Well, you guys have been friends   forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?   You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that. Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,   we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna   power through! (Joey walks in) Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points   to the hall). Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through   (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment). (Chandler resumes staring at Monica's bra) Monica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler,   stop! It is not going to pop open! Chandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't   know! (Monica just smiles) [Scene: Central Perk.] (Phoebe is sitting on the couch. Monica walks in.) Monica: Hey Phoebe! Phoebe: Hey! Monica: Is Amanda here yet? Phoebe: No. Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look   I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.   Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency. Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here? Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident? Phoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it! (A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda) Phoebe: Hi! Monica: Hi! Amanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug) Amanda: (To Monica) Hello! (Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda   hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.) Amanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you!   Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as   well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch   my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places   them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to   sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married! Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is   Chandler and... Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's   not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent! (Monica looks shocked) Phoebe: Musty! Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like   old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again! Monica: When were we not friends? Amanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was   the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly). Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992. Amanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging   her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.  Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut   me out? Phoebe: Well...kinda. Monica: Oh My God! Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like   a perfect arse! Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass". (Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.) Monica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,   what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)   Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up) Phoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my   God. Was Mike with him? Monica: Nope! (She turns and leaves) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.] (Joey comes running in.) Joey: (To Rachel) Hey! Rachel: Hey! Got champagne? Joey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through! Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone   is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove   her bra from under her clothes)... Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)  Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very   sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!   Lets do it! Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit. Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She   pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like   that huh? Joey: Oh! yeah! Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,   putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She   pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between   his legs and begins to kiss his neck.) Joey: uh uh! Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it! Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters! Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok? Joey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with   a painful look on his face) Soldier down! [Monica and Chandlers apartment.] (Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.) Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore. Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok! (Phoebe and Amanda walk in) Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute? Monica: I have nothing to say to   you. Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,   my flat is twice this size! Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall? (They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.) Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly. Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat. [Scene: The hallway] Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why? Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill. Monica: I'm still all those things! Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy! Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy. Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in. Monica: It's because I'm scrappy. Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you. Monica: I won't know what I would do without   you. (They hug) Monica: Well, I guess we should go back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda. Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right. (They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for   Chandler, but she's really terrible at it) Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional   dance training. (Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again) [Scene: A different spray-on tan center] (Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.) Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the   booth, and... Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does   it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back. Glenda: (quietly) Okay... (Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands   with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles   at both sides of the wall) Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it? (He turns around frantically from side to side.) Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it? (He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in   this face and front again.) Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH! (He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's] (Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other) Rachel: What is the matter with us? Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me. Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult? Joey: I don't know. (Chandler enters the apartment) Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey! Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that? Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys... Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally... Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong? Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time. (Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get   to them) Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the   joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs) Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us. Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit. Rachel: Right, totally. Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it. Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex. Joey: That's a... pla-an. (They both stare for a while, and then look at each other) Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming. Rachel: I know.  Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted.  Rachel: Hmmm... Me too... (She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.) Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it? Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are. (Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder) Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right. (They look at each other for a while) Joey: So... Rachel: Yeah. Joey: I love ya. Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed. Joey: Yeah, me too. (Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.) Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while. (Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on   his sore spot)  ENDING CREDITS  [Scene: Ross's apartment.] (Ross is reading a National Geographic on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the door.) Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. (Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.) Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody. Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in. Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily? (Ross walks to the door and opens it.) Ross: Dude, you're not tanned. Chandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this. (Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.) Chandler: I see you later! (Ross closes the door)  end

Chandler and Monica look up at him smiling.)  Chandler: Hold on! There is something different. Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested. Chandler: Was that place... The Sun? Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler   and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,   where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.) Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself! Monica: How could you mess this up? It's   so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!! Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five? Monica: One Two Three... Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel   just enters, sees him and starts laughing) Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh! Ross: (Still yelling) I Know! Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic? Chandler: How was your date with Joey? Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away! Chandler: You didn't like that? Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out   too! He couldn't even undo my bra! Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open. (Chandler starts looking at her bra) Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me. Monica: Well, you guys have been friends   forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?   You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that. Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,   we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna   power through! (Joey walks in) Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points   to the hall). Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through   (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment). (Chandler resumes staring at Monica's bra) Monica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler,   stop! It is not going to pop open! Chandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't   know! (Monica just smiles) [Scene: Central Perk.] (Phoebe is sitting on the couch. Monica walks in.) Monica: Hey Phoebe! Phoebe: Hey! Monica: Is Amanda here yet? Phoebe: No. Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look   I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.   Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency. Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here? Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident? Phoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it! (A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda) Phoebe: Hi! Monica: Hi! Amanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug) Amanda: (To Monica) Hello! (Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda   hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.) Amanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you!   Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as   well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch   my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places   them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to   sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married! Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is   Chandler and... Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's   not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent! (Monica looks shocked) Phoebe: Musty! Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like   old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again! Monica: When were we not friends? Amanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was   the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly). Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992. Amanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging   her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.  Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut   me out? Phoebe: Well...kinda. Monica: Oh My God! Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like   a perfect arse! Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass". (Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.) Monica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,   what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)   Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up) Phoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my   God. Was Mike with him? Monica: Nope! (She turns and leaves) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.] (Joey comes running in.) Joey: (To Rachel) Hey! Rachel: Hey! Got champagne? Joey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through! Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone   is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove   her bra from under her clothes)... Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)  Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very   sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!   Lets do it! Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit. Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She   pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like   that huh? Joey: Oh! yeah! Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,   putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She   pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between   his legs and begins to kiss his neck.) Joey: uh uh! Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it! Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters! Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok? Joey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with   a painful look on his face) Soldier down! [Monica and Chandlers apartment.] (Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.) Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore. Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok! (Phoebe and Amanda walk in) Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute? Monica: I have nothing to say to   you. Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,   my flat is twice this size! Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall? (They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.) Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly. Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat. [Scene: The hallway] Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why? Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill. Monica: I'm still all those things! Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy! Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy. Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in. Monica: It's because I'm scrappy. Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you. Monica: I won't know what I would do without   you. (They hug) Monica: Well, I guess we should go back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda. Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right. (They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for   Chandler, but she's really terrible at it) Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional   dance training. (Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again) [Scene: A different spray-on tan center] (Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.) Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the   booth, and... Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does   it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back. Glenda: (quietly) Okay... (Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands   with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles   at both sides of the wall) Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it? (He turns around frantically from side to side.) Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it? (He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in   this face and front again.) Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH! (He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's] (Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other) Rachel: What is the matter with us? Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me. Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult? Joey: I don't know. (Chandler enters the apartment) Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey! Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that? Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys... Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally... Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong? Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time. (Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get   to them) Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the   joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs) Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us. Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit. Rachel: Right, totally. Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it. Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex. Joey: That's a... pla-an. (They both stare for a while, and then look at each other) Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming. Rachel: I know.  Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted.  Rachel: Hmmm... Me too... (She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.) Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it? Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are. (Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder) Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right. (They look at each other for a while) Joey: So... Rachel: Yeah. Joey: I love ya. Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed. Joey: Yeah, me too. (Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.) Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while. (Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on   his sore spot)  ENDING CREDITS  [Scene: Ross's apartment.] (Ross is reading a National Geographic on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the door.) Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. (Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.) Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody. Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in. Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily? (Ross walks to the door and opens it.) Ross: Dude, you're not tanned. Chandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this. (Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.) Chandler: I see you later! (Ross closes the door)  end    
Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler   and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,   where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)

Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel   just enters, sees him and starts laughing)

Joey: I love ya. Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed. Joey: Yeah, me too. (Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.) Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while. (Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on   his sore spot)  ENDING CREDITS  [Scene: Ross's apartment.] (Ross is reading a National Geographic on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the door.) Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. (Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.) Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody. Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same   thing happened to me. You have to let me in. Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily? (Ross walks to the door and opens it.) Ross: Dude, you're not tanned. Chandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this. (Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.) Chandler: I see you later! (Ross closes the door)  end    
Joey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with   a painful look on his face) Soldier down! [Monica and Chandlers apartment.] (Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.) Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore. Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok! (Phoebe and Amanda walk in) Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute? Monica: I have nothing to say to   you. Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,   my flat is twice this size! Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall? (They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.) Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look   positively ghastly. Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat. [Scene: The hallway] Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut   me out. Why Phoebe, why? Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill. Monica: I'm still all those things! Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy! Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy. Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in. Monica: It's because I'm scrappy. Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you. Monica: I won't know what I would do without   you. (They hug) Monica: Well, I guess we should go back   in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda. Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right. (They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for   Chandler, but she's really terrible at it) Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional   dance training. (Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again) [Scene: A different spray-on tan center] (Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.) Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the   booth, and... Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does   it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back. Glenda: (quietly) Okay... (Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands   with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles   at both sides of the wall) Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it? (He turns around frantically from side to side.) Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it? (He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in   this face and front again.) Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH! (He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.) [Scene: Joey and Rachel's] (Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other) Rachel: What is the matter with us? Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me. Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult? Joey: I don't know. (Chandler enters the apartment) Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey! Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that? Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys... Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally... Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong? Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt   like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time. (Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get   to them) Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the   joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs) Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us. Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit. Rachel: Right, totally. Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it. Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex. Joey: That's a... pla-an. (They both stare for a while, and then look at each other) Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming. Rachel: I know.  Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted.  Rachel: Hmmm... Me too... (She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.) Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it? Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are. (Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder) Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right. (They look at each other for a while) Joey: So... Rachel: Yeah.

Ross, Rachel and Chandler: Hey! Chandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend. Monica: That place in Vermont? You can  take   a hint! Rachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday! Ross: Yeah! Rachel: We're having a party. Monica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back? Ross: No. Rachel: No,    that day... that won't be her real birthday! Chandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday    was! Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us. Monica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.    You know, to reconnect... emotionally. Chandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim... Rachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day? Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing    weird sex stuff to my little sister. Rachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can    we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle! Monica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party. Chandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this    party... Monica: Believe me, that is not why we won't    be doing that!   OPENING CREDITS  [Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment] Rachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would    hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure    map to help me find 'em all. Phoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm...    when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood    to buy us food! Ross: (he enters) Hey guys! Rachel and Phoebe: Hi! Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video. Rachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma    and we'll give it to her when she is 18. Phoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule! Ross: Yeah! Phoebe: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't    even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And    they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant    people! Ross: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet? Rachel: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon. Ross: Ah, and where is Joey? Rachel: I said it's still nap time. (Joey comes out from his room, yawning) Ross: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey! Joey: Hey! Ross: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday! Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'"    line)  Ross: Joey, NO! Joey: What, what!? it's for her hot friends! Ross: When they see this you'll be 52! Joey: And starting to think about settling down! Rachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents    on? Joey: I'd love to! Yeah!   Joey: (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents? Phoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song. Joey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know? Phoebe: Joey, it's a birthday party. Joey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed    for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as    a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"!    (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup! (Monica and Chandler enter) Monica: Hey! Chandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl? Rachel: Oh, she's still napping Chandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party    she knows is happening. Rachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't    a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a    first birthday again. Monica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and    get the fun time started! Rachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up. Monica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green? (someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it) Jack and Judy: HI! Ross: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey! Monica: So glad you came! Jack: I can't believe Emma is already one! Judy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the    attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to    take him to the emergency room!  Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know    about your dad! Joey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that. Jack: Thank you! Joey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what    would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us! Jack: Which one are you?  (Time lapse) Monica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep! Chandler: I know, what are we gonna do? Monica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really    hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up! Chandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica! Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,    maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!  Phoebe: So you’re gonna... hit on her? Joey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor! Phoebe: Oh! Joey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one    of her books! Phoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple! Joey: Hey, I think Emma might like it! Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what? Joey: Um, my present! Rachel: What did you get her? Joey: Actually we prepared performances. Phoebe: Separate performances. Joey: But equally real! Rachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are    getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind    performing them once now? Phoebe: Sure, yeah! Joey: (unconfidently) O K. Rachel: (to everybody) All right, let’s get this party started, huh?    Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us. Ross: Oh, great! Phoebe: (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing    prepared? Joey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole    crew waiting! Rachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us? Joey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books. Rachel: Oh, ok, which one? Joey: Uh, why, it’s a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh,    (he reads the title of the book) “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum    depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love    you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly    books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico.    A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and    forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love    you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby    you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book).    And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll    like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”. Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing! Ross: Thank you so much for that gift! Chandler (nearly weeping): I was not ready for this today! Ross: Amazing... amazing. Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well. Phoebe: That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to    hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts    singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!    Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy    birthday Emma! Rachel: Is that it? Phoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks    up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot. Everybody: No, no, no, no, no! [Scene: Joey’s Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ] Judy: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday. Jack: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years. Judy: Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your    grandfather and I might not be here. Jack: That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the    grave, Emma! Judy: After all, my parents died very young. Jack: And my cholesterol’s off the charts! Judy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too! Ross (stops recording): Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was    just... yeah! Rachel: Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s    in a box in the fridge. Ross: Sure. Rachel: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey,    Corino’s. Monica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike    there when I was a kid. Rachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different    shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing! Monica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma? Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny. Ross: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say    for bachelorette parties? Rachel: Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God!    They put my baby’s face on a penis! Phoebe (sees the cake): oh! Now it’s a party! Rachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to    be a disaster I would have baked it myself! Joey (staring at the cake): Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious? Judy:(to Jack) Jack, look at this. Jack: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny! Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again. Rachel (on the phone): No, no, this is not what I ordered.    Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for    my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now! Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the    penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence! Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even    want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a    piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!! Joey: I'm so confused! Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want    my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with    nuts! Chandler: To be fair this one does have nuts. (Time lapse) (Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area) Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could    go and get the cake. Monica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!  Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message    to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica    and Chandler) Ok! Chandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap? Monica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.   You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years! Chandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together    and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed    and switches the camcorder off) Monica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to    go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in    a half hour. Phoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon. Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be    back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh? Monica: Alright, 5 more minutes. (The phone rings, Ross picks up) Ross: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some    more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right    there. (Puts the phone down) Chandler: Was that Emma? Is she up?  Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot    her licence so now I have to bring it to her. Phoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go. Monica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler)    We've been complaining the longest! Ross: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad    that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes    back here and all you guys are gone? Chandler: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!  Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves) Joey: Got it! (Goes towards the front door   and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?  Chandler: To the bathroom! Joey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna    be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there! Phoebe: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards    the bathroom and enter) Chandler: (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and    Joey come out looking shocked) Joey: Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it. Phoebe: No, it did not. Joey: No. Judy: Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at    night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane. Jack: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger    scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime. Judy: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you. Joey: Ok! (Opens the door for them)  Judy: Bye... Bye dear. Joey: Nighty-night! Judy: Nighty-night! Joey: Bye, bye. Phoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave? Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he    fought for our country. Monica: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea. Joey: (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you    guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it) Chandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right? Joey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here! (The phone rings, Joey picks up) Joey: Hello? Estelle: (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle! Joey: Hey! (smiles) Estelle: So, how did your audition go today? Joey: (smile fades) What audition? Estelle: The one I told you about last week? Joey: What? You never said anything about an audition! Estelle: (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition.    I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to    have a monologue prepared. Joey: A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for    his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room)    Aah! so... I'm gonna take off! Phoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client    waiting outside my door any minute! Monica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right    now! Phoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as    the person who realized that, I get to go! Monica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying. Joey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever    gets the highest number gets to go first. Monica: (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten. Joey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else? Phoebe: No, lets just draw straws. Joey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the.. Chandler: I'm begging you stop. Joey: Right. Monica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday.    We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays! Phoebe: (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that! Chandler: (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going    to do in Vermont!  Monica: Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys) Phoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin! Chandler: Thats a bear. Phoebe: I'm too excited! Monica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler    and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks    the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes    in last, stays! Joey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so) Chandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!! (Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.) Phoebe: Go! Go! Joey: Come on robot! (Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is    Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking,    sits, walks again, and so on... ) Monica: (to the dog) What are you barking at? (While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's    robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.) Monica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help? Chandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do? (Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot) Joey: Way to go robot! Phoebe: Good job Alan! Joey: Hey, good race you guys. Phoebe: Yeah, see you later! (Joey and Phoebe leave for the door) Monica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly    stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog    never crossed the finish line, so technically... Chandler: They left. (Monica turns to see the closed door.)  [ Scene: The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while    using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]  Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just    gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna    be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye... (She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which    is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she    turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.) Ross: RACHEL! Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry! Ross: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a    good driver. (Ross fastens his seat belt.) Rachel: Emma's awake. Ross: Yeah? Rachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're    not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake. Ross: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.    (he opens the box) Rachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday...    And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According    to the back cover of that book that you gave me. Ross: Rach, she's not going to remember this. Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this    day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her    cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET    OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks    at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn! Ross: (looks back at the cake) Hey! Rachel: What? Ross: It's not bad. Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a    bunny. How did you do that? Ross: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this    to make ears. Rachel: Well, I'm very impressed. Ross: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into    woodland creatures.  [ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma    are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of    them.]  Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size. Chandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica? Monica: Game? Chandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old,    that's little. (With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger    and babbles...) Chandler: Ooh! That's my girl! Monica: That's how old you are. Chandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom? Monica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one... Chandler: Me too... (There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...) Chandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one? Monica: ...and head to Canada! Chandler: I was kidding. Monica: I wasn't. Let's get going! (Phoebe enters the apartment again.) Phoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back? Chandler: No, not yet. Phoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party. Monica: What about your massage client? Phoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something,    you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright. (Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.) Joey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE    TIME! (Ross and Rachel enter.) Joey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time! Ross: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs. Rachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks    you guys! Chandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did. Rachel: What? Chandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index    finger again) Emma: Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger) (Ross and Rachel gasp) Rachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many! Ross: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means... Rachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp! Ross: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake. Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly! Monica: Thanks! Ross: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow    out the candle. Come on Emma. Chandler: Let's do it, come on! (Rachel wipes away some tears.) Ross: What's wrong? Are you okay? Rachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted. Phoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny. Joey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it    was a penis.  ENDING CREDITS   [Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel.    They put the camera on a tripod in the kitchen and they are standing in front    of the camera.] Rachel: Okay. Ross: Okay, you ready? Rachel: Yeah. Ross: A-a-and... record. Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well,    your first birthday is over, and it was really... (There's a lot of yelling and screaming coming from the hallway, and they get    up to look at what's the noise all about. In the hallway, Monica, Chandler,    Joey and Phoebe are having another wind-up animal race, yelling and screaming    fanatically.) Phoebe: (yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!   end    
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: No.
Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing    weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Ross: (he enters) Hey guys!
Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Ross: Ah, and where is Joey?
Ross: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Ross: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'"    line)  Ross: Joey, NO!
Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!
Ross: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!
Judy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the    attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to    take him to the emergency room!  Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know    about your dad!
Ross: Oh, great!
Ross: Thank you so much for that gift!
Ross: Amazing... amazing.
Ross: Sure.
Ross: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say    for bachelorette parties?
Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the    penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!
Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could    go and get the cake.
Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message    to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica    and Chandler) Ok!
Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be    back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Ross: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some    more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right    there. (Puts the phone down)
Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot    her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Ross: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad    that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes    back here and all you guys are gone?
Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
 Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just    gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna    be there as soon as we can.

Joey: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time! Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you? Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from    a can! Monica: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we    were wondering if you would write one for us. Rachel: Of course, I'd be honored! Chandler: Thanks! Monica: Thank you! (Joey looks at them, disappointed about their decision) Joey: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight. Chandler: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested. Monica: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with    the words". Joey: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!! Monica: Clearly we were wrong. Joey: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how    much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one. Monica: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it. Joey: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby    adoption decider people..." Chandler: So excited about your letter! (Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Hey! All: Hey Phoebe! Joey: Hey! Monica: Wow! Don't you look nice?! Phoebe: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary. Rachel: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss,    first time you had sex... Phoebe: YEAH! Chandler: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate? Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game. Joey: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed? Phoebe: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so    no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put    on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room. Monica: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom! Chandler: That's where people make number two!!  OPENING CREDITS  [Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross is grading papers. Charlie approaches    him.]   Charlie: Hey!

I'd love to    but I really have to grade these papers. Charlie: Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself... Ross: (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B! Charlie: Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue. Ross: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt. (they start kissing but someone knocks at the door) Ross: Damnit!

Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma) Ross: Ehm... Her name is Emma. Amy: Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier! Ross: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart! Amy: Hey, your English is getting better!! Ross: (to Joey) Oh my God! Joey: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated. Ross: What... what you working on?

Joey: What did I just say? Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word    you want to change.   Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list    of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest. Joey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm...

But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there. Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the    apartment more than you like... Amy: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old! Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married    somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry? Amy: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went    to sleep. Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever   made. Honey, you deserve   true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age,   that is smart, that is fun and that you care about! Amy: (thinks about it) You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna    do it! Rachel: Ok. Amy: I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking   for Mr Right. Rachel: Ok, let’s keep talking.   [Scene: Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to    their seats.]   Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking    at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my    seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe    it's been a whole year!  Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so    he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE! Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH! Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY! Phoebe: YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE    AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S    OUR ANNIVERSARY! Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the    screen there’s written ‘Julie, will you marry me?’ and goes    on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her) Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal. Mike: Really? Phoebe: Oh, it’s the worst way to propose! Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes  what she did).   [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Joey enters the room]   Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to    Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. Chandler: (reading) I don’t... uh... understand. Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya? Monica: (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense. Joey: Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus! Chandler: On every word? Joey: Yep! Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to    Joey) Joey: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. Chandler: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...? Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude. Monica: Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this. Joey: Why not? Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that'    look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself! Chandler: You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.   [Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joey’s door and Rachel    opens the door.]   Rachel: Amy, hi! Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron. Rachel: Oh, good for you!  Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich! Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you! Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you? Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house. (Joey comes out of Monica’s apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does    not notice the huge amount of bags) Joey: Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH,    WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS? Amy: Well, I’m staying with you guys! Joey: What? Amy: We’re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey,  snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!   [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel is in the living room    and Joey comes out of his room.]   Joey: You slept out here? Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get    off!’ Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re    getting rid of her. Rachel: Joey, I can’t do that! Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping    Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"    I don’t need that kind of talk in my house! Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think    it’s really good that she’s here. Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone? Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me. Joey: Yeah, Monica made us! Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys.    See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok. Amy: Good morning. Joey: Yeaah. Rachel: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why    I hung it on the door. Amy: Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off. Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. Amy: Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points    at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands)    Oh... sure you wanna eat that? Joey: (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!   [Scene: Monica’s Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler    are there, Phoebe enters the room]   Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year. Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song. Ross: Seriously? Chandler: Word! Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that. Rachel: Well, what happened? Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing... Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky. Phoebe: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night! Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose? Rachel: Phoebe, that’s huge! Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him? Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this! Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself   mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a   guy..? Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him! Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate? Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright,    moving on... Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing! Monica: Thank you. Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think   I should propose? Rachel: I think it could be kind of great! Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it! Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it? Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen? Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands    together, faking excitement) Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it! Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points    to Ross and Chandler) like that? Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  (Amy walks in carrying a phone handset) Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel) Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years    ago!! Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca? Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes    back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!    (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?    Because my throat's been hurting? Rachel: Menstrual cramps. Ross: I don't think that's what this is. Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma? Monica: No, sorry sweety.. Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.. Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do? Amy: Well, I can do it. Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...  Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other    side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.? Rachel: Yeah. Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child. Rachel: Why not? Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!  Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name! Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella. Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one? Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby. Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge    breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!! Ross: I... I don't know.. Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points    at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand    how important that is in our world? (Amy approaches from behind) Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to...    Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's    been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly) (Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently) Rachel: Absolutely. Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up  and leaves)   [Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk    in.]   Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming? Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency. (Chandler and Monica look shocked) Monica: You dropped it off? Joey: Yeah. Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy? Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to    hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked) Monica: You hand-wrote it? Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at   all! See ya later! (Leaves) Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds! Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing) Monica: Okay good. Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused). Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way    to the bird store. Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it. Monica: What? Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter. Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child? Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. (Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller) Amy: Hi! Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today? Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. Chandler: That sounds like fun. Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull. (Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma) Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl? Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready? Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah! (Amy takes off Emma's hat) Amy: Ta-daaa! (Rachel looks at Emma) Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!? Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller? (Rachel looks very shocked) COMMERCIAL BREAK  Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?  Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would    it? Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily)    ... but I am wrong! Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out. Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart? Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it) (Ross enters) Ross: Hey guys.   Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross. Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.    (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him). Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see.  Ross: Why not? Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world. Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat? Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi! (Rachel looks worried) Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What? Rachel: Nothing. Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from    him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he    realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.  Rachel: Oh, they're real! Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have    left Emma with her! Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)   You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again! Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs    to have a cool fun aunt! Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt! Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay! Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects! Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me? Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going    to do with my life. Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when? Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist. Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What? Ross: That's not a thing! Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what    colors to wear, what clothes are slimming... Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim. Amy: Enter Amy! Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna... Amy: What? What are you gonna do? Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you! (Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant  and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)   [Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the    game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]   Mike: Great game, huh? Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted) Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen? Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank    you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going? Mike: Going go to the bathroom. Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait. Mike: Why? Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients. Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask. (We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then    we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of    Mike.) Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered) Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing   to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.   (people are laughing, while   Mike still seems bewildered) Phoebe: That's not very enlightened! (There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand    in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him) Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!   [Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone    rings.]   Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...    Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was    nice! (Rachel and Amy enter) Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out! Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room) Amy: You're kicking me out?  Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears! Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl! Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help   you. You are so  beyond help. Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative. Rachel: Excuse me? Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then,    I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing    at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy? Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags? Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap! Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great.    Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without    that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way... Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously? Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds. Rachel: Hips or thighs? Amy: Ass and face. Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins. Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking    about real stuff. Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that. Amy: You can? Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...    you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are. Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute. Rachel: Did you just say Emma? Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.  [Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]   Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about. Mike, obviously you have balls. Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing. Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider    it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake. (Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.) Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it? Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he    takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin) Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm    sorry! Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and    all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my    life with you. (Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face) Mike: I'm gonna do this now. Phoebe: Oh my God! (Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.) Mike: Phoebe, I... Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring    finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was    wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.) Mike: Ready? Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly) Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry    me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow    old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Phoebe: Yes! (Mike puts the ring on her finger) Mike: I love you! Phoebe: I love you more! Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna    be Mrs. No Balls. (They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.) COMMERCIAL BREAK   [Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are    walking on the sidewalk.]   Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going? Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies    are ugly.  Rachel: That's shocking! Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand,    whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to    Rachel) He's rude! THE END     
Ross: Hey...
Ross: (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to    but I really have to grade these papers.
Ross: (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!
Ross: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Ross: Damnit!
Ross: (he opens the door) Hi Amy!
Ross: Still sharp as a tack!
Ross: (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together    last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Ross: (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.
Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need   pec implants!  
Ross: Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Ross: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Ross: (to Joey) Oh my God!
Ross: What... what you working on?
Ross: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word    you want to change.   Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list    of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
   Rachel: God! Amy: So beautiful. Rachel: Oh, I know, isn't she? Amy: No, I was talking about your bedding. Rachel: All right. What's your news, Amy? Amy: Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married. Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who? Amy: This guy! He has a killer apartment. Rachel: A-And?? Amy: A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room. Rachel: No, what's he like?

You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.   [Scene: The corridor.

See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok. Amy: Good morning. Joey: Yeaah. Rachel: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why    I hung it on the door. Amy: Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off. Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. Amy: Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points    at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands)    Oh... sure you wanna eat that? Joey: (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!   [Scene: Monica’s Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler    are there, Phoebe enters the room]   Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year. Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song. Ross: Seriously? Chandler: Word! Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that. Rachel: Well, what happened? Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing... Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky. Phoebe: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night! Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose? Rachel: Phoebe, that’s huge! Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him? Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this! Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself   mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a   guy..? Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him! Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate? Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright,    moving on... Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing! Monica: Thank you. Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think   I should propose? Rachel: I think it could be kind of great! Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it! Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it? Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen? Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands    together, faking excitement) Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it! Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points    to Ross and Chandler) like that? Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  (Amy walks in carrying a phone handset) Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel) Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years    ago!! Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca? Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes    back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!    (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?    Because my throat's been hurting? Rachel: Menstrual cramps. Ross: I don't think that's what this is. Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma? Monica: No, sorry sweety.. Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.. Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do? Amy: Well, I can do it. Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...  Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other    side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.? Rachel: Yeah. Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child. Rachel: Why not? Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!  Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name! Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella. Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one? Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby. Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge    breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!! Ross: I... I don't know.. Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points    at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand    how important that is in our world? (Amy approaches from behind) Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to...    Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's    been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly) (Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently) Rachel: Absolutely. Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up  and leaves)   [Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk    in.]   Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming? Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency. (Chandler and Monica look shocked) Monica: You dropped it off? Joey: Yeah. Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy? Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to    hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked) Monica: You hand-wrote it? Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at   all! See ya later! (Leaves) Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds! Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing) Monica: Okay good. Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused). Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way    to the bird store. Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it. Monica: What? Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter. Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child? Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. (Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller) Amy: Hi! Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today? Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. Chandler: That sounds like fun. Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull. (Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma) Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl? Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready? Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah! (Amy takes off Emma's hat) Amy: Ta-daaa! (Rachel looks at Emma) Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!? Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller? (Rachel looks very shocked) COMMERCIAL BREAK  Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?  Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would    it? Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily)    ... but I am wrong! Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out. Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart? Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it) (Ross enters) Ross: Hey guys.   Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross. Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.    (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him). Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see.  Ross: Why not? Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world. Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat? Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi! (Rachel looks worried) Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What? Rachel: Nothing. Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from    him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he    realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.  Rachel: Oh, they're real! Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have    left Emma with her! Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)   You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again! Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs    to have a cool fun aunt! Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt! Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay! Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects! Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me? Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going    to do with my life. Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when? Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist. Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What? Ross: That's not a thing! Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what    colors to wear, what clothes are slimming... Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim. Amy: Enter Amy! Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna... Amy: What? What are you gonna do? Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you! (Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant  and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)   [Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the    game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]   Mike: Great game, huh? Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted) Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen? Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank    you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going? Mike: Going go to the bathroom. Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait. Mike: Why? Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients. Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask. (We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then    we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of    Mike.) Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered) Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing   to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.   (people are laughing, while   Mike still seems bewildered) Phoebe: That's not very enlightened! (There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand    in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him) Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!   [Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone    rings.]   Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...    Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was    nice! (Rachel and Amy enter) Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out! Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room) Amy: You're kicking me out?  Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears! Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl! Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help   you. You are so  beyond help. Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative. Rachel: Excuse me? Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then,    I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing    at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy? Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags? Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap! Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great.    Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without    that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way... Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously? Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds. Rachel: Hips or thighs? Amy: Ass and face. Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins. Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking    about real stuff. Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that. Amy: You can? Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...    you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are. Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute. Rachel: Did you just say Emma? Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.  [Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]   Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about. Mike, obviously you have balls. Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing. Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider    it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake. (Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.) Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it? Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he    takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin) Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm    sorry! Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and    all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my    life with you. (Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face) Mike: I'm gonna do this now. Phoebe: Oh my God! (Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.) Mike: Phoebe, I... Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring    finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was    wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.) Mike: Ready? Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly) Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry    me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow    old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Phoebe: Yes! (Mike puts the ring on her finger) Mike: I love you! Phoebe: I love you more! Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna    be Mrs. No Balls. (They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.) COMMERCIAL BREAK   [Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are    walking on the sidewalk.]   Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going? Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies    are ugly.  Rachel: That's shocking! Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand,    whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to    Rachel) He's rude! THE END     
 Rachel: God! Amy: So beautiful. Rachel: Oh, I know, isn't she? Amy: No, I was talking about your bedding. Rachel: All right. What's your news, Amy? Amy: Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married. Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who? Amy: This guy! He has a killer apartment. Rachel: A-And?? Amy: A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room. Rachel: No, what's he like? Amy: Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark? Rachel: Yeah. Amy: It's his dad. Rachel: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be... Amy: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there. Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the    apartment more than you like... Amy: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old! Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married    somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry? Amy: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went    to sleep. Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever   made. Honey, you deserve   true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age,   that is smart, that is fun and that you care about! Amy: (thinks about it) You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna    do it! Rachel: Ok. Amy: I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking   for Mr Right. Rachel: Ok, let’s keep talking.   [Scene: Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to    their seats.]   Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking    at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my    seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe    it's been a whole year!  Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so    he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE! Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH! Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY! Phoebe: YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE    AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S    OUR ANNIVERSARY! Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the    screen there’s written ‘Julie, will you marry me?’ and goes    on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her) Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal. Mike: Really? Phoebe: Oh, it’s the worst way to propose! Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes  what she did).   [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Joey enters the room]   Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to    Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. Chandler: (reading) I don’t... uh... understand. Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya? Monica: (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense. Joey: Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus! Chandler: On every word? Joey: Yep! Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to    Joey) Joey: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. Chandler: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...? Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude. Monica: Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this. Joey: Why not? Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that'    look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself! Chandler: You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.   [Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joey’s door and Rachel    opens the door.]   Rachel: Amy, hi! Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron. Rachel: Oh, good for you!  Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich! Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you! Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you? Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house. (Joey comes out of Monica’s apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does    not notice the huge amount of bags) Joey: Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH,    WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS? Amy: Well, I’m staying with you guys! Joey: What? Amy: We’re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey,  snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!   [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel is in the living room    and Joey comes out of his room.]   Joey: You slept out here? Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get    off!’ Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re    getting rid of her. Rachel: Joey, I can’t do that! Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping    Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"    I don’t need that kind of talk in my house! Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think    it’s really good that she’s here. Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone? Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me. Joey: Yeah, Monica made us! Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys.    See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok. Amy: Good morning. Joey: Yeaah. Rachel: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why    I hung it on the door. Amy: Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off. Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. Amy: Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points    at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands)    Oh... sure you wanna eat that? Joey: (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!   [Scene: Monica’s Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler    are there, Phoebe enters the room]   Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.

Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca? Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes    back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!    (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?    Because my throat's been hurting?

Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter. Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child? Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. (Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller) Amy: Hi! Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today? Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. Chandler: That sounds like fun. Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull. (Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma) Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl? Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready? Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah! (Amy takes off Emma's hat) Amy: Ta-daaa! (Rachel looks at Emma) Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!? Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller? (Rachel looks very shocked) COMMERCIAL BREAK  Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?  Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would    it? Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily)    ... but I am wrong! Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out. Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart? Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it) (Ross enters) Ross: Hey guys.   Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross. Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.    (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him). Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see.  Ross: Why not? Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world. Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat? Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi! (Rachel looks worried) Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What? Rachel: Nothing. Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from    him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he    realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.  Rachel: Oh, they're real! Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have    left Emma with her! Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)   You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again! Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs    to have a cool fun aunt! Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt! Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay! Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects! Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me? Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going    to do with my life. Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when? Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist. Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What? Ross: That's not a thing! Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what    colors to wear, what clothes are slimming... Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim. Amy: Enter Amy! Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna... Amy: What? What are you gonna do? Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you! (Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant  and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)   [Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the    game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]   Mike: Great game, huh? Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted) Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen? Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank    you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going? Mike: Going go to the bathroom. Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait. Mike: Why? Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients. Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask. (We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then    we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of    Mike.) Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered) Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing   to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.   (people are laughing, while   Mike still seems bewildered) Phoebe: That's not very enlightened! (There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand    in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him) Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!   [Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone    rings.]   Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...    Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was    nice! (Rachel and Amy enter) Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out! Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room) Amy: You're kicking me out?  Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears! Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl! Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help   you. You are so  beyond help. Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative. Rachel: Excuse me? Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then,    I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing    at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy? Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags? Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap! Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great.    Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without    that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way... Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously? Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds. Rachel: Hips or thighs? Amy: Ass and face. Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins. Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking    about real stuff. Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that. Amy: You can? Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...    you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are. Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute. Rachel: Did you just say Emma? Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.  [Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]   Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about. Mike, obviously you have balls. Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing. Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider    it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake. (Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.) Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it? Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he    takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin) Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm    sorry! Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and    all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my    life with you. (Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face) Mike: I'm gonna do this now. Phoebe: Oh my God! (Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.) Mike: Phoebe, I... Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring    finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was    wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.) Mike: Ready? Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly) Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry    me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow    old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Phoebe: Yes! (Mike puts the ring on her finger) Mike: I love you! Phoebe: I love you more! Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna    be Mrs. No Balls. (They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.) COMMERCIAL BREAK   [Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are    walking on the sidewalk.]   Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going? Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies    are ugly.  Rachel: That's shocking! Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand,    whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to    Rachel) He's rude! THE END     
  Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking    at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my    seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe    it's been a whole year!  Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so    he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE! Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH! Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY! Phoebe: YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE    AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S    OUR ANNIVERSARY! Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the    screen there’s written ‘Julie, will you marry me?’ and goes    on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her) Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal. Mike: Really? Phoebe: Oh, it’s the worst way to propose! Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes  what she did).   [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Joey enters the room]   Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to    Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. Chandler: (reading) I don’t... uh... understand. Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya? Monica: (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense. Joey: Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus! Chandler: On every word? Joey: Yep! Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to    Joey) Joey: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. Chandler: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...? Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude. Monica: Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this. Joey: Why not? Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that'    look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself! Chandler: You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.   [Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joey’s door and Rachel    opens the door.]   Rachel: Amy, hi! Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron. Rachel: Oh, good for you!  Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich! Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you! Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you? Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house. (Joey comes out of Monica’s apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does    not notice the huge amount of bags) Joey: Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH,    WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS? Amy: Well, I’m staying with you guys! Joey: What? Amy: We’re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey,  snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!   [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel is in the living room    and Joey comes out of his room.]   Joey: You slept out here? Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get    off!’ Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re    getting rid of her. Rachel: Joey, I can’t do that! Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping    Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"    I don’t need that kind of talk in my house! Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think    it’s really good that she’s here. Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone? Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me. Joey: Yeah, Monica made us! Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys.    See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok. Amy: Good morning. Joey: Yeaah. Rachel: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why    I hung it on the door. Amy: Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off. Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. Amy: Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points    at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands)    Oh... sure you wanna eat that? Joey: (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!   [Scene: Monica’s Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler    are there, Phoebe enters the room]   Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year. Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song. Ross: Seriously? Chandler: Word! Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that. Rachel: Well, what happened? Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing... Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky. Phoebe: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night! Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose? Rachel: Phoebe, that’s huge! Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him? Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this! Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself   mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a   guy..? Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him! Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate? Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright,    moving on... Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing! Monica: Thank you. Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think   I should propose? Rachel: I think it could be kind of great! Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it! Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it? Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen? Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands    together, faking excitement) Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it! Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points    to Ross and Chandler) like that? Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  (Amy walks in carrying a phone handset) Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel) Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years    ago!! Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca? Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes    back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!    (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?    Because my throat's been hurting? Rachel: Menstrual cramps. Ross: I don't think that's what this is. Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma? Monica: No, sorry sweety.. Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.. Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do? Amy: Well, I can do it. Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...  Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other    side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.? Rachel: Yeah. Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child. Rachel: Why not? Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!  Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name! Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella. Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one? Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby. Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge    breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!! Ross: I... I don't know.. Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points    at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand    how important that is in our world? (Amy approaches from behind) Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to...    Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's    been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly) (Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently) Rachel: Absolutely. Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up  and leaves)   [Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk    in.]   Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming? Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency. (Chandler and Monica look shocked) Monica: You dropped it off? Joey: Yeah. Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy? Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to    hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked) Monica: You hand-wrote it? Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at   all! See ya later! (Leaves) Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds! Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing) Monica: Okay good. Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused). Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way    to the bird store. Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it. Monica: What? Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter. Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child? Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. (Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller) Amy: Hi! Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today? Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. Chandler: That sounds like fun.

(she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring    finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was    wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.) Mike: Ready? Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly) Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry    me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow    old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Phoebe: Yes! (Mike puts the ring on her finger) Mike: I love you! Phoebe: I love you more! Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna    be Mrs. No Balls. (They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.) COMMERCIAL BREAK   [Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are    walking on the sidewalk.]   Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going? Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies    are ugly.  Rachel: That's shocking! Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand,    whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to    Rachel) He's rude! THE END     
Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking    at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my    seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe    it's been a whole year!  Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so    he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE! Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH! Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY! Phoebe: YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE    AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S    OUR ANNIVERSARY! Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the    screen there’s written ‘Julie, will you marry me?’ and goes    on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her) Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal. Mike: Really? Phoebe: Oh, it’s the worst way to propose! Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes  what she did).   [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Joey enters the room]   Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to    Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. Chandler: (reading) I don’t... uh... understand. Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya? Monica: (also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense. Joey: Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus! Chandler: On every word? Joey: Yep! Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to    Joey) Joey: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. Chandler: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...? Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude. Monica: Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this. Joey: Why not? Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that'    look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself! Chandler: You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.   [Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joey’s door and Rachel    opens the door.]   Rachel: Amy, hi! Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron. Rachel: Oh, good for you!  Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich! Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you! Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you? Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house. (Joey comes out of Monica’s apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does    not notice the huge amount of bags) Joey: Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH,    WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS? Amy: Well, I’m staying with you guys! Joey: What? Amy: We’re gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey,  snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!   [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel is in the living room    and Joey comes out of his room.]   Joey: You slept out here? Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get    off!’ Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re    getting rid of her. Rachel: Joey, I can’t do that! Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping    Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"    I don’t need that kind of talk in my house! Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think    it’s really good that she’s here. Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone? Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me. Joey: Yeah, Monica made us! Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys.    See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok. Amy: Good morning. Joey: Yeaah. Rachel: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why    I hung it on the door. Amy: Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off. Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. Amy: Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points    at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands)    Oh... sure you wanna eat that? Joey: (yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!   [Scene: Monica’s Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler    are there, Phoebe enters the room]   Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year. Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song. Ross: Seriously? Chandler: Word! Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that. Rachel: Well, what happened? Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing... Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky. Phoebe: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night! Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose? Rachel: Phoebe, that’s huge! Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him? Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this! Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself   mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a   guy..? Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him! Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate? Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright,    moving on... Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing! Monica: Thank you. Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think   I should propose? Rachel: I think it could be kind of great! Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it! Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it? Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen? Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands    together, faking excitement) Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it! Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points    to Ross and Chandler) like that? Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  (Amy walks in carrying a phone handset) Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel) Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years    ago!! Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca? Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes    back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye!    (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had?    Because my throat's been hurting? Rachel: Menstrual cramps. Ross: I don't think that's what this is. Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma? Monica: No, sorry sweety.. Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.. Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do? Amy: Well, I can do it. Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...  Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other    side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.? Rachel: Yeah. Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child. Rachel: Why not? Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!  Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name! Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella. Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one? Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby. Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge    breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!! Ross: I... I don't know.. Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points    at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand    how important that is in our world? (Amy approaches from behind) Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to...    Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's    been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly) (Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently) Rachel: Absolutely. Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up  and leaves)   [Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk    in.]   Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming? Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency. (Chandler and Monica look shocked) Monica: You dropped it off? Joey: Yeah. Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy? Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to    hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked) Monica: You hand-wrote it? Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at   all! See ya later! (Leaves) Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds! Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing) Monica: Okay good. Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused). Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way    to the bird store. Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it. Monica: What? Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter. Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child? Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings. (Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller) Amy: Hi! Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today? Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. Chandler: That sounds like fun. Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull. (Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma) Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl? Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready? Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah! (Amy takes off Emma's hat) Amy: Ta-daaa! (Rachel looks at Emma) Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!? Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller? (Rachel looks very shocked) COMMERCIAL BREAK  Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?  Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would    it? Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily)    ... but I am wrong! Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out. Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart? Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it) (Ross enters) Ross: Hey guys.   Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross. Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.    (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him). Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see.  Ross: Why not? Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world. Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat? Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi! (Rachel looks worried) Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What? Rachel: Nothing. Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from    him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he    realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.  Rachel: Oh, they're real! Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have    left Emma with her! Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy)   You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again! Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs    to have a cool fun aunt! Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt! Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay! Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects! Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me? Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going    to do with my life. Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when? Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist. Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What? Ross: That's not a thing! Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what    colors to wear, what clothes are slimming... Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim. Amy: Enter Amy! Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna... Amy: What? What are you gonna do? Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you! (Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant  and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)   [Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the    game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]   Mike: Great game, huh? Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted) Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen? Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank    you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going? Mike: Going go to the bathroom. Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait. Mike: Why? Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients. Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the    big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask. (We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then    we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of    Mike.) Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered) Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing   to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.   (people are laughing, while   Mike still seems bewildered) Phoebe: That's not very enlightened! (There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand    in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him) Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!   [Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone    rings.]   Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...    Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was    nice! (Rachel and Amy enter) Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out! Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room) Amy: You're kicking me out?  Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears! Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl! Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help   you. You are so  beyond help. Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative. Rachel: Excuse me? Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then,    I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing    at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy? Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags? Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap! Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great.    Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without    that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way... Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously? Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds. Rachel: Hips or thighs? Amy: Ass and face. Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins. Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking    about real stuff. Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that. Amy: You can? Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...    you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are. Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute. Rachel: Did you just say Emma? Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.  [Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]   Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about. Mike, obviously you have balls. Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing. Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider    it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake. (Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.) Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it? Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he    takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin) Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm    sorry! Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and    all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my    life with you. (Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face) Mike: I'm gonna do this now. Phoebe: Oh my God! (Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.) Mike: Phoebe, I... Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait!

All: Hey! Rachel: Hi! Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong? Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...    (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring! All: OH! Rachel: My God! Joey: Hey!  Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!! Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared,    or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise,    I like proposals! Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the   most romantic thing ever. Joey: Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe)    Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...    (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike! All: Whoo! Phoebe: Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for    you! Rachel: Mmh-mmh! Phoebe: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers    of all the guys I've dated. Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what,    I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?   Phoebe: I would, but you're the last one. Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start    reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"? Phoebe: Oh, my first love!  Rachel: Oh! Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean? Phoebe: Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no,   he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave   at Omaha Beach. Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my    black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.    With Janice's phone number on it. Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band? Phoebe: (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.  OPENING CREDITS  [Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]   Chandler: (he enters) Hey honey! Joey: (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back.    Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie! Chandler: Is Monica not here? Joey: No. Chandler: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for   a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial! Joey: Cool! Chandler: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas    were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were   mine!!! Joey: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it? Chandler: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're    right for the part. Joey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!    Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired!    (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh??    Come on! What can't I do? Chandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think    you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor. Joey: I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm    your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.    I like to use..." Oh, what's the product? Chandler: Software that facilitates inter-business networking    e-solutions? Joey: (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!    [Scene: Central Perk. Charlie is sitting on the couch and Ross    enters.]   Ross: (to Charlie) Hey! Charlie: Hey! Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research   grant!  I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.  Charlie: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand    up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!  Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds    of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not      that I'm keeping score or anything... five! Charlie: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant! Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get    it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there    will be  an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah!    That'll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious    questions    about my work! Charlie: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant? Ross: Yeah. Why? Charlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant. Ross: Your ex-boyfriend? Charlie: Yeah. Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new    boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed! Charlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything,    I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner    together, and I can introduce you. Ross: Well, if you think it would help. Charlie: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him. Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,    butter him up? Anything he really likes? Charlie: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish. Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.   [Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She is packing a few tings into boxes.] Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey!  Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie? Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing    out stuff, so Mike could move in. Monica: Oh, right. Phoebe: Yeah.  Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you    with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker! Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did   you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together? Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?  Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me    to get rid of Gladys. Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting    with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and    she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss! Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,   I know!! Oh, you should take her! Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know... Phoebe: Why, you don't like her? Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll    take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too    easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her! Phoebe: Really? You think? Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry    Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!" Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just    realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her. Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!  [Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]    Chandler: Hey you guys.  Rachel: Hi! Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet? Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for    the part. Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor    you'd buy some kind of e-crap from? Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna    be interested in. Joey (to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's    not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I    am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man,    I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a    copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. Chandler: Joe... Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses! Chandler: Fine! Joey: Thank you. (he sits down) Chandler: Work, Joe! Joey: Damn it! (he leaves) Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now? Joey: Just pass it to your boss! Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest    him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should    learn on their own! Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked    it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and    they're the bad guys. Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't.    (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake,    go to work! (Joey runs away).  [Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend,    Benjamin Hobart]    Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.    I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner    party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley    or C3PO? Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks    like it's just him. Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning! Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day. Benjamin: So good to see you. Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long    and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop) Ross: I'm ok. Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross    Geller... Benjamin Hobart. Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell    you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,    (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of    the reasons I got into the field. Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've    never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!  Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross'    chair). Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't    believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night? Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh   my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh   more, and Ross start laughing too). Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there! Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,    you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz,    mmm. Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,    while I go to the ladies room? Benjamin: So, tell me about it. Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert. Benjamin: M-m. Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't    been fully excavated. Benjamin: Break up with Charlie! Ross: What? Benjamin: What? Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"? Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I    didn't not say it. Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so    long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much    I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her. Ross: Are you serious? Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then    I'm joking! Ross: No! Benjamin: Joking it is!  [Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]   Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late. Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you    keep the painting? Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me    keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news    is, Gladys is yours! Monica: Wow, what's the bad news! Rachel: Who's Gladys? Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,    with the woman coming out of the frame. Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?   In her house? I am so jealous! Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too! Monica: Huh! Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already    gave that to Monica, so... Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you. Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that. Monica: But I want to. Rachel: But I don't want you to. Monica: But I insist! Rachel: But I insist harder! Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,    she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the    coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours! Monica: No, that landed in your food! Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair    and square. I'm so sad!  [Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]   Chandler: Hey Joe! Joey: What's up? Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested. Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh. Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man. Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched    the tape? Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey    continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.    Stupid sons of bitches! Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape. Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did! Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it! Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room    and is observing the conversation) Chandler: I watched it! Joey: Keep going Pinocchio! Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did! Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards    his room) Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape.    (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face) Rachel: Did you watch the tape? Chandler:(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone)    No!  [Scene: Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man,    one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting    on the other side]   Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of    you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers    you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you    claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you    propose to correct this problem? Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological    evidence. I plan to begin there. Benjamin: (nods) Interesting. Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess! Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.    Where might that take place? Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota. Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my    birthday? Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I...    (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question") Benjamin: Care to venture a guess? Ross: (annoyed) May 12th? Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even    kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students    you'd be needing? Dr. Li: Half a dozen. Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely? Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis. Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit    was later covered by a popular British invasion band? Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.   Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's    You". Baby It's You. Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my    questions have anything to do with Paleontology. Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.    Spell "Boscodictiasaur". Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur". Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it. Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it    correctly) B - O - S ... Benjamin: No, it starts with a silent "M". Ross: Oh come on!!  [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are    talking.]   Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar! Rachel: But you are a liar. Chandler: What did I just say? (Joey comes out of his room) Joey: You still here? Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am    insulted. When I tell somebody I did something... Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?    First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about    lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying    about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in    the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying! Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape? Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?    (goes back into his room)  Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried) Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't    watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this    tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I    got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play    and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins) (The commercial: Joey says "Ichiban". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey    fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them    saying "Lipstick For Men!" It goes on to show him playing a guitar    and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively "Ichiban...    Lipstick For Men" and "Sahiko" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel    are speechless.)  Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you    didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).  (Silence) Chandler: He really is a chameleon.  [Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific    'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]   Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to    your new home! (she holds out the 'painting') Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my!  Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh,    she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh    so proudly? (looks around for a spot)  Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to    do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet! Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to    the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be    the first thing that you see when you walk in the door! Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can    get rid of that French poster. Monica: (offended) I like that poster! Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.    Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom? Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's    nothing above your bed!! Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here? [Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]   Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology    related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling)    Aunt Margaret's pants size? Benjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have    let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.  Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop!  Benjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.  Ross: (Skeptical) Really? Benjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation... Ross: I have to break up with Charlie? Benjamin: Hey, you got one right! (Ross shakes his head)  Ross: You're crazy. Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic? Ross: Crazy! Benjamin: Ooor... Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)  [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.] (Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on    the barcalounger.) Rachel: O-oh my God! Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What? Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here? Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very    reasonable price. Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this! Joey: But it's an original Buffay... Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't    mind that she's haunted.  Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!? Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive    when you're asleep. (Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys    and back.) Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body    across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice)    And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your    doorknob. Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE! (Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters    Monica's apartment.) Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey. Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at    this game. (gives Gladys to Monica) Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes    the painting back to Rachel) Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again) Monica: No you can't. She's yours! Rachel: She's yours! Monica: SHE'S YOURS! Rachel: She's yours! (While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause) Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's m-i-i-ne! Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's mine! Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her    anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous    painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress    and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls    are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are    gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.) Rachel: I want Gladys! Monica: She's mine! Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's mine! Rachel: She's mine! [Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports    Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.] Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And    I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part    or not. Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you    lied. Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you    to forgive me?  [Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.] Monica: Oh my God! (we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler is wearing the blue    Ichiban lipstick!) Rachel: Excellent! Joey: Now, what do you say? Chandler: Lying is wrong! Joey: And?... AND? Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl. Phoebe: I knew it!  [Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has    left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.] Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane. Charlie: Did you get the grant? Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your    ex-boyfriend is still in love with you. Charlie: What? Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't    give you up. Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up    with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man. Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,    who was the voice of "Underdog"? Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross. Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?    I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question. Charlie: Seriously? Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do    you spell Mboscodictiosaur? Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then    M-B-O...  Ross: Damnit!  [Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.] Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are    you doing here? Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you    tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the    voice of Underdog! Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,    this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in    the eyes, and tell her the truth. Charlie: Benji? Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's    only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in    my life. Ross: Too little, too late, Benji! Charlie: I can't believe this. Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think    about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?  Ross: (indignant) No! Charlie: Yes! Ross: What? Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so....    romantic. Ross: or... Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,    but is there any chance you will take me back? Charlie: Maybe... Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a    little uncomfortable. Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand    on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know... Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry    too... (Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down Ross's face, until their    hands meet, and they hold hands.) Benjamin: I love you! Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss) Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!    COMMERCIAL BREAK  [Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin    right next to him.] (There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from the living room, and    Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.) Joey: Gladys? (The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her frame though. Joey panics    and moves frantically, screaming. Then there is laughing, and the painting is    lowered. It was Rachel holding Gladys.)  Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not    get old. Joey: You're mean! Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby! (She closes his door again, and turns around. Then she starts screaming, terrified.    There is Glynnis... And Monica holding her up, laughing.)  end        
Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong?
Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared,    or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise,    I like proposals!
Ross: (to Charlie) Hey!
Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research   grant!  I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you. 
Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds    of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not      that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get    it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there    will be  an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah!    That'll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious    questions    about my work!
Ross: Yeah. Why?
Ross: Your ex-boyfriend?
Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new    boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Ross: Well, if you think it would help.
Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,    butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.
Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey!  Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie? Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing    out stuff, so Mike could move in. Monica: Oh, right. Phoebe: Yeah.  Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you    with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker! Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did   you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together? Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you  to give  up?  Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me    to get rid of Gladys. Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting    with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and    she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss! Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh,   I know!! Oh, you should take her! Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know... Phoebe: Why, you don't like her? Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll    take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too    easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her! Phoebe: Really? You think? Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry    Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!" Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just    realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her. Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!  [Scene: Central Perk.

It's    not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I    am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man,    I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a    copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. Chandler: Joe... Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses! Chandler: Fine! Joey: Thank you. (he sits down) Chandler: Work, Joe! Joey: Damn it! (he leaves) Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now? Joey: Just pass it to your boss! Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest    him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should    learn on their own! Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked    it, but your bosses didn't.

(he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake,    go to work! (Joey runs away).  [Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend,    Benjamin Hobart]    Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.    I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner    party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley    or C3PO? Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks    like it's just him. Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning! Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day. Benjamin: So good to see you. Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long    and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop) Ross: I'm ok. Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross    Geller... Benjamin Hobart. Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell    you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,    (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of    the reasons I got into the field. Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've    never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!  Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross'    chair). Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't    believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night? Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh   my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh   more, and Ross start laughing too). Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there! Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,    you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz,    mmm. Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,    while I go to the ladies room? Benjamin: So, tell me about it. Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert. Benjamin: M-m. Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't    been fully excavated. Benjamin: Break up with Charlie! Ross: What? Benjamin: What? Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"? Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I    didn't not say it. Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so    long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much    I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her. Ross: Are you serious? Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then    I'm joking! Ross: No! Benjamin: Joking it is!  [Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]   Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late. Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you    keep the painting? Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me    keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news    is, Gladys is yours! Monica: Wow, what's the bad news! Rachel: Who's Gladys? Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,    with the woman coming out of the frame. Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?   In her house? I am so jealous! Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too! Monica: Huh! Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already    gave that to Monica, so... Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you. Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that. Monica: But I want to. Rachel: But I don't want you to. Monica: But I insist! Rachel: But I insist harder! Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,    she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the    coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours! Monica: No, that landed in your food! Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair    and square. I'm so sad!  [Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]   Chandler: Hey Joe! Joey: What's up? Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested. Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh. Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man. Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched    the tape? Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey    continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.    Stupid sons of bitches! Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape. Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did! Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it! Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room    and is observing the conversation) Chandler: I watched it! Joey: Keep going Pinocchio! Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did! Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards    his room) Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape.    (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face) Rachel: Did you watch the tape? Chandler:(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone)    No!  [Scene: Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man,    one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting    on the other side]   Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of    you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers    you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you    claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you    propose to correct this problem? Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological    evidence. I plan to begin there. Benjamin: (nods) Interesting. Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess! Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.    Where might that take place? Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota. Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my    birthday? Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I...    (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question") Benjamin: Care to venture a guess? Ross: (annoyed) May 12th? Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even    kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students    you'd be needing? Dr. Li: Half a dozen. Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely? Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis. Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit    was later covered by a popular British invasion band? Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.   Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's    You". Baby It's You. Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my    questions have anything to do with Paleontology. Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.    Spell "Boscodictiasaur". Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur". Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it. Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it    correctly) B - O - S ... Benjamin: No, it starts with a silent "M". Ross: Oh come on!!  [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are    talking.]   Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar! Rachel: But you are a liar. Chandler: What did I just say? (Joey comes out of his room) Joey: You still here? Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am    insulted. When I tell somebody I did something... Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?    First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about    lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying    about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in    the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying! Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape? Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?    (goes back into his room)  Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried) Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't    watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this    tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I    got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play    and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins) (The commercial: Joey says "Ichiban". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey    fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them    saying "Lipstick For Men!" It goes on to show him playing a guitar    and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively "Ichiban...    Lipstick For Men" and "Sahiko" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel    are speechless.)  Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you    didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).  (Silence) Chandler: He really is a chameleon.  [Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific    'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]   Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to    your new home! (she holds out the 'painting') Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my!  Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh,    she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh    so proudly? (looks around for a spot)  Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to    do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet! Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to    the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be    the first thing that you see when you walk in the door! Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can    get rid of that French poster. Monica: (offended) I like that poster! Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.    Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom? Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's    nothing above your bed!! Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here? [Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]   Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology    related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling)    Aunt Margaret's pants size? Benjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have    let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.  Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop!  Benjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.  Ross: (Skeptical) Really? Benjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation... Ross: I have to break up with Charlie? Benjamin: Hey, you got one right! (Ross shakes his head)  Ross: You're crazy. Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic? Ross: Crazy! Benjamin: Ooor... Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)  [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.] (Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on    the barcalounger.) Rachel: O-oh my God! Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What? Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here? Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very    reasonable price. Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this! Joey: But it's an original Buffay... Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't    mind that she's haunted.  Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!? Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive    when you're asleep. (Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys    and back.) Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body    across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice)    And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your    doorknob. Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE! (Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters    Monica's apartment.) Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey. Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at    this game. (gives Gladys to Monica) Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes    the painting back to Rachel) Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again) Monica: No you can't. She's yours! Rachel: She's yours! Monica: SHE'S YOURS! Rachel: She's yours! (While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause) Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's m-i-i-ne! Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's mine! Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her    anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous    painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress    and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls    are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are    gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.) Rachel: I want Gladys! Monica: She's mine! Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's mine! Rachel: She's mine! [Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports    Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.] Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And    I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part    or not. Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you    lied. Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you    to forgive me?  [Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.] Monica: Oh my God! (we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler is wearing the blue    Ichiban lipstick!) Rachel: Excellent! Joey: Now, what do you say? Chandler: Lying is wrong! Joey: And?... AND? Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl. Phoebe: I knew it!  [Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has    left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.] Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane. Charlie: Did you get the grant? Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your    ex-boyfriend is still in love with you. Charlie: What? Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't    give you up. Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up    with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man. Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,    who was the voice of "Underdog"? Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross. Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?    I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question. Charlie: Seriously? Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do    you spell Mboscodictiosaur? Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then    M-B-O...  Ross: Damnit!  [Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.] Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are    you doing here? Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you    tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the    voice of Underdog! Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,    this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in    the eyes, and tell her the truth. Charlie: Benji? Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's    only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in    my life. Ross: Too little, too late, Benji! Charlie: I can't believe this. Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think    about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?  Ross: (indignant) No! Charlie: Yes! Ross: What? Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so....    romantic. Ross: or... Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,    but is there any chance you will take me back? Charlie: Maybe... Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a    little uncomfortable. Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand    on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know... Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry    too... (Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down Ross's face, until their    hands meet, and they hold hands.) Benjamin: I love you! Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss) Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!    COMMERCIAL BREAK  [Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin    right next to him.] (There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from the living room, and    Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.) Joey: Gladys? (The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her frame though. Joey panics    and moves frantically, screaming. Then there is laughing, and the painting is    lowered. It was Rachel holding Gladys.)  Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not    get old. Joey: You're mean! Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby! (She closes his door again, and turns around. Then she starts screaming, terrified.    There is Glynnis... And Monica holding her up, laughing.)  end        
   Chandler: Hey you guys.  Rachel: Hi! Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet? Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for    the part. Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor    you'd buy some kind of e-crap from? Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna    be interested in. Joey (to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's    not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I    am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man,    I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a    copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. Chandler: Joe... Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses! Chandler: Fine! Joey: Thank you. (he sits down) Chandler: Work, Joe! Joey: Damn it! (he leaves) Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now? Joey: Just pass it to your boss! Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest    him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should    learn on their own! Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked    it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and    they're the bad guys. Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't.    (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake,    go to work! (Joey runs away).  [Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend,    Benjamin Hobart]    Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.    I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner    party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley    or C3PO? Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks    like it's just him. Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning! Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day. Benjamin: So good to see you. Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long    and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop) Ross: I'm ok. Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross    Geller... Benjamin Hobart. Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell    you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,    (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of    the reasons I got into the field. Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've    never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!  Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross'    chair). Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't    believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night? Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh   my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh   more, and Ross start laughing too). Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there! Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,    you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz,    mmm. Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,    while I go to the ladies room? Benjamin: So, tell me about it. Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert. Benjamin: M-m. Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't    been fully excavated. Benjamin: Break up with Charlie! Ross: What? Benjamin: What? Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"? Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I    didn't not say it. Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so    long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much    I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her. Ross: Are you serious? Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then    I'm joking! Ross: No! Benjamin: Joking it is!  [Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]   Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late. Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you    keep the painting? Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me    keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news    is, Gladys is yours! Monica: Wow, what's the bad news! Rachel: Who's Gladys? Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,    with the woman coming out of the frame. Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?   In her house? I am so jealous! Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too! Monica: Huh! Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already    gave that to Monica, so... Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you. Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that. Monica: But I want to. Rachel: But I don't want you to. Monica: But I insist! Rachel: But I insist harder! Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,    she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the    coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours! Monica: No, that landed in your food! Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair    and square. I'm so sad!

Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this! Joey: But it's an original Buffay... Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't    mind that she's haunted.  Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!? Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive    when you're asleep. (Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys    and back.) Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body    across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice)    And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your    doorknob. Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE! (Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters    Monica's apartment.) Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey. Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at    this game. (gives Gladys to Monica) Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes    the painting back to Rachel) Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again) Monica: No you can't. She's yours! Rachel: She's yours! Monica: SHE'S YOURS! Rachel: She's yours! (While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters) Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause) Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's m-i-i-ne! Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's mine! Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her    anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous    painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress    and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls    are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are    gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.) Rachel: I want Gladys! Monica: She's mine! Rachel: She's mine! Monica: She's mine! Rachel: She's mine! [Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports    Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.] Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And    I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part    or not. Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you    lied. Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you    to forgive me?  [Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.] Monica: Oh my God! (we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler is wearing the blue    Ichiban lipstick!) Rachel: Excellent! Joey: Now, what do you say? Chandler: Lying is wrong! Joey: And?... AND? Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl. Phoebe: I knew it!  [Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has    left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.] Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane. Charlie: Did you get the grant? Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your    ex-boyfriend is still in love with you. Charlie: What? Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't    give you up. Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up    with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man. Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,    who was the voice of "Underdog"? Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross. Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?    I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question. Charlie: Seriously? Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do    you spell Mboscodictiosaur? Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then    M-B-O...  Ross: Damnit!  [Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.] Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are    you doing here? Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you    tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the    voice of Underdog! Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,    this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in    the eyes, and tell her the truth. Charlie: Benji? Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's    only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in    my life. Ross: Too little, too late, Benji! Charlie: I can't believe this. Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think    about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?  Ross: (indignant) No! Charlie: Yes! Ross: What? Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so....    romantic. Ross: or... Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,    but is there any chance you will take me back? Charlie: Maybe... Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a    little uncomfortable. Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand    on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know... Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry    too... (Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down Ross's face, until their    hands meet, and they hold hands.) Benjamin: I love you! Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss) Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!    COMMERCIAL BREAK  [Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin    right next to him.] (There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from the living room, and    Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.) Joey: Gladys? (The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her frame though. Joey panics    and moves frantically, screaming. Then there is laughing, and the painting is    lowered. It was Rachel holding Gladys.)  Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not    get old. Joey: You're mean! Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby! (She closes his door again, and turns around. Then she starts screaming, terrified.    There is Glynnis... And Monica holding her up, laughing.)  end        
Chandler: Hey you guys.  Rachel: Hi! Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet? Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for    the part. Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor    you'd buy some kind of e-crap from? Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna    be interested in. Joey (to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's    not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I    am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man,    I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a    copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. Chandler: Joe... Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses! Chandler: Fine! Joey: Thank you. (he sits down) Chandler: Work, Joe! Joey: Damn it! (he leaves) Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now? Joey: Just pass it to your boss! Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest    him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should    learn on their own! Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked    it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and    they're the bad guys. Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't.    (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake,    go to work! (Joey runs away).  [Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend,    Benjamin Hobart]    Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.    I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner    party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley    or C3PO? Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks    like it's just him. Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning! Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day. Benjamin: So good to see you. Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long    and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop) Ross: I'm ok. Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross    Geller... Benjamin Hobart. Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell    you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,    (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of    the reasons I got into the field. Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've    never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!  Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross'    chair). Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't    believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night? Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh   my  God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh   more, and Ross start laughing too). Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there! Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,    you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz,    mmm. Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,    while I go to the ladies room? Benjamin: So, tell me about it. Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert. Benjamin: M-m. Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't    been fully excavated. Benjamin: Break up with Charlie! Ross: What? Benjamin: What? Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"? Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I    didn't not say it. Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so    long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much    I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her. Ross: Are you serious? Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then    I'm joking! Ross: No! Benjamin: Joking it is!  [Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]   Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late. Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you    keep the painting? Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me    keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news    is, Gladys is yours! Monica: Wow, what's the bad news! Rachel: Who's Gladys? Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,    with the woman coming out of the frame. Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?   In her house? I am so jealous! Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too! Monica: Huh! Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already    gave that to Monica, so... Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you. Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that. Monica: But I want to. Rachel: But I don't want you to. Monica: But I insist! Rachel: But I insist harder! Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,    she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the    coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours! Monica: No, that landed in your food! Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair    and square. I'm so sad!  [Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]   Chandler: Hey Joe! Joey: What's up? Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested. Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh. Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man. Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched    the tape? Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey    continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.    Stupid sons of bitches! Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape. Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did! Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it! Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room    and is observing the conversation) Chandler: I watched it! Joey: Keep going Pinocchio! Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did! Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards    his room) Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape.    (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face) Rachel: Did you watch the tape? Chandler:(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone)    No!  [Scene: Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man,    one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting    on the other side]   Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of    you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers    you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you    claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you    propose to correct this problem? Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological    evidence. I plan to begin there. Benjamin: (nods) Interesting. Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess! Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.    Where might that take place? Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota. Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my    birthday? Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I...    (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question") Benjamin: Care to venture a guess? Ross: (annoyed) May 12th? Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even    kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students    you'd be needing? Dr. Li: Half a dozen. Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely? Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis. Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit    was later covered by a popular British invasion band? Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.   Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's    You". Baby It's You. Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my    questions have anything to do with Paleontology. Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.    Spell "Boscodictiasaur". Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur". Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it. Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it    correctly) B - O - S ... Benjamin: No, it starts with a silent "M". Ross: Oh come on!!  [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are    talking.]   Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar! Rachel: But you are a liar. Chandler: What did I just say? (Joey comes out of his room) Joey: You still here? Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am    insulted. When I tell somebody I did something... Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?    First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about    lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying    about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in    the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying! Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape? Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?    (goes back into his room)  Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried) Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't    watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this    tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I    got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play    and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins) (The commercial: Joey says "Ichiban". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey    fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them    saying "Lipstick For Men!" It goes on to show him playing a guitar    and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively "Ichiban...    Lipstick For Men" and "Sahiko" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel    are speechless.)  Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you    didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).  (Silence) Chandler: He really is a chameleon.  [Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific    'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]   Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to    your new home! (she holds out the 'painting') Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my!  Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh,    she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh    so proudly? (looks around for a spot)  Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to    do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet! Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to    the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be    the first thing that you see when you walk in the door! Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can    get rid of that French poster. Monica: (offended) I like that poster! Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.    Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom? Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's    nothing above your bed!! Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here? [Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]   Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology    related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling)    Aunt Margaret's pants size? Benjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have    let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.  Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop!  Benjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.  Ross: (Skeptical) Really? Benjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation... Ross: I have to break up with Charlie? Benjamin: Hey, you got one right! (Ross shakes his head)  Ross: You're crazy. Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic? Ross: Crazy! Benjamin: Ooor... Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)  [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.] (Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on    the barcalounger.) Rachel: O-oh my God!

Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do    you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Ross: Damnit! 
Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you    tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the    voice of Underdog!
Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in    the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!
Ross: (indignant) No!
Ross: What?
Ross: or...
Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a    little uncomfortable.
Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!

Phoebe and Mike are sitting on the couch, reading a magazine.) Ross: Hey you guys! Phoebe: Hey! Ross: Hey, what are you doing? Mike: Oh, figuring out our wedding plans. Chandler: That's funny, we were doing the same thing! Ross: Yeah! Phoebe: It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea    how expensive this stuff was! Chandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the    numbers. Phoebe: So what did you two do about it? Chandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting    solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell. Ross: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact    that this is gonna cost you a lot of money. Mike: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry. Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that. Phoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use? Mike: Are you serious? Phoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity    and we just got married at City Hall? Mike: I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. (he kisses her) Ross: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture! Chandler: (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married! Ross: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But    maybe the time after that!  Opening Credits  [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment] (Monica is cleaning the table, Chandler is sitting on the sofa. Joey enters.) Joey: Hey! Chandler: Hey! Joey: What's going on? Chandler: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning    the apartment. Monica: (sarcastically) We? Chandler: You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways! Joey: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby? Chandler: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live. Monica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about    us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state. Joey: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very    impressive when the little people know a celebrity. Chandler: (pointing at himself) Little people? Joey: (pointing at himself) Celebrity. Monica: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff    hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes? Chandler: What...? NO! Monica: Chandler? Chandler: (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended    by the insinuation! Monica: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes    taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR? Chandler: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not    mine. Monica: It isn't mine! Joey: (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose    it is!     [Scene: The New York City Children's fund hallway.] Charity guy: May I help you?  Phoebe: Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children. Charity guy: Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated. Phoebe: Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she    gives him a check) Charity guy: Well, this is very generous! Phoebe: And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous. Mike: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers. Phoebe: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay. Charity guy: Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter. Mike: Not necessary. Phoebe: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y. Mike: And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan". Charity guy: Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much. Phoebe: Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good! Mike: It does. It feels really good! Phoebe: Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which    was on the counter) Charity guy: Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym. Phoebe: Mhm... it's moist.   [Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.] Ross: (he enters) Hi! Rachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute! Ross: Oh, good! Rachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry. Ross: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists    out there. Rachel: Absolutely. Ross: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under    a bridge! Rachel: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today? Ross: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground! Rachel: Oh my God, what!? Ross: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and    fire! Rachel: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground. Ross: Be-caaauuuse... Rachel: (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing    incident... when I was little. Ross: Seriously? Rachel: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden    my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut    a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks! Ross: (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you    in the movie! Rachel: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And    I was thinking Claire Danes. Ross: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly    safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and    you'll see! Rachel: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and    there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're    gonna return back to earth!  Ross: Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come    on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you    won’t regret it. Rachel: All right! Ross: Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their    irrational fears on their children, do you? Rachel: Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next    time you freak out about a spider in your apartment! Ross: Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different    species of poisonous swings!  [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door] Monica: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early! Chandler: Ok, ok, here we go. Monica: Ok. Chandler: Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door    and both are smiling exaggeratedly) Phoebe: Hello, is this the creepy residence? Monica: We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad    you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a    box on the table and opens it). I don’t know if you wanna use it, but… Phoebe: Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing    a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all! Monica: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!  Phoebe: No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money    we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity. Monica: That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t    imagine giving up my one wedding day like that! Phoebe: We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having    a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh,    please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex    image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares,    I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress. Monica: That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s    the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it? Phoebe: City Hall. Monica: Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just    there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up! Phoebe: It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want    is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth) Monica: Yay! Chandler: But you already gave all your money to charity! Phoebe: Well, I’ll just ask for it back! Chandler: I don’t think you can do that! Monica: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some    stupid kids! Chandler: That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.  [Scene: The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they’re    ready to play] Rachel: Ok, careful. Ross: Ok. Rachel: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR! Ross: Rach, she’s got like three hairs! Rachel: I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful!    Oh, my God, I just pulled one out. Ross: I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.  Rachel: Ok. Ross (to Emma): Ready sweety? Rachel: Ok. Ross: Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma) Rachel: Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God,    she does like it! Ross: See, I told you! Rachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil!    Oh, let me push, can I push? Ross: Oh, absolutely! Rachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag. Ross: Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared    of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!     [Scene: The New York City Children's fund ] Mike: We’re seriously asking for our money back? Phoebe: It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,    because one of us gonna have to start flirting. Charity guy: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t    think that that’s ever happened before. Phoebe (to Mike): Gay, go. Mike (to the charity guy): Oh my God, I love your shirt! Phoebe: The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it    back. Charity guy: Excuse me? Phoebe: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t    want, but it turns out we do. Charity guy: So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children? Mike: Yeah! This feels really good. Phoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me. Charity guy: Hey, it’s not my business, (he takes their check from a    drawer) besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been    spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing… Phoebe: Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important!    And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t    go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an    escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me”    or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty    little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out) Mike: She could have been talking about either one of us.   [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door] Laura: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview. Monica: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in. Laura: Thank you! Monica: Would you like something to drink? Laura: Oh, water would be fine. Monica: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited    about getting this process started. Chandler: Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually    to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...    as allowed by law. Laura: Your place is just lovely. Monica: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it. Laura: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples    in the    building adopting? Monica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby    before    them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked) Chandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building. Laura: Oh... Chandler: What? Laura: I just realized why I remember this place. Monica: Really? What is it? Laura: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building    and it    didn't end very well. Monica: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani? Laura: Yes! Chandler: Of course it was! Laura: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he    would call    me and he didn't. Chandler: RAT BASTARD! Laura: So you're not friends with him? Monica and Chandler: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,    no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No! Laura: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning    on staying at    home with your child... (someone knocks on the door) Joey: (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?       (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it    back in    his face) OW! Laura: What was that? Chandler: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great    with    kids though.   [Scene: Ross and Rachel are at the playground with Emma. Rachel    in putting her back in the stroller and Ross is tending to his wound] Rachel: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay? Ross: SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him)    (To the    kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away) Rachel: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.    That is    the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life. Ross: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault    and kind    of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing.    Nice.  Rachel: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else    gets    hurt? Ross: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,    okay? And    you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.  Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've    always been    jealous of my hair. Ross: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your    silly    fears. Rachel: Alright fine. I'll do it. Ross: Good. Rachel: If you hold a spider.  Ross: (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT?    WHERE? WHERE? Rachel: IF you hold a spider. Ross: I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,       afraid)  [Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler is still leaning    against the door, keeping Joey out, who is still banging and shouting on the    other side.] Joey: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe... Chandler: (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!! Laura: What's going on? Chandler: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey    bangs on    the door again) Joey: Guys!? Monica: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today! Joey: What's going on? Chandler: WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!  (cut to Joey on the other side, who finally leaves the door and goes to his    apartment) Joey: Everything doesn't sound fine! Laura: Is he alright out there by himself? Chandler: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie. Laura: Bert and Ernie! Chandler: (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!  [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike enter] Mike: You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm    sorry about    that. Phoebe: (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.  Mike: Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really    deserve that. Phoebe: Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for    a few    seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from. Mike: No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there. Phoebe: Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted. Mike: Alright, fine. We'll give the money back. Phoebe: And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't    shot    anyone in a really long time.   [Scene: Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing    to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler    and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other. Laura: Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child    in. Monica: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the    furniture,    because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there! Laura: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything    I need    up to here... (She starts checking her form. Chandler sees movement near the window from       the corner of his eye and when he looks he spots Joey climbing up the fire escape    and    onto their balcony. He warns Monica silently.) Monica: (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room? (Joey enters through the side window and jogs towards the kitchen holding a    baseball bat) Chandler: What the hell are you doing? Joey: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble. Chandler: Well, we're not. Joey: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger! Chandler: We don't have a code word. Joey: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word    for danger. (Monica talks loudly in the baby's room) Monica: So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey    behind    the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler) Monica: (To Chandler) What room should we see next? Chandler: Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously) Monica: (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people    don't    get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom). (Joey gets up and look annoyed) Joey: (quivering with anger) I did not care for that! Chandler: (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept    with    our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so    she can't    see you. Joey: Ok, ok! (He leaves) Chandler: Ok! (Joey leaves and closes the door behind him. Chandler walks towards the living    room, but then Joey enters again.) Chandler: What? Joey: I forgot my bat. (He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica and Laura enter the living    room again. When Laura sees Joey, she freezes...) Laura: Oh my God! Chandler: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And    we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat) Laura: What are you doing here? Joey: (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert! Laura: Are you friends with him? Chandler: I can explain... Joey... Joey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back    here. I can't believe you never called me. Laura: Excuse me? Joey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by    the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me. Laura: I gave you my number, you never called me. Joey: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do. Laura: (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave    you my number. Joey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you? Laura: I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry... Joey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the    apartment, leaving her shocked) Laura: Joey, wait! Joey: (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes    the door behind him) Laura: (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed... Chandler: Oh, that's really ok. Monica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard. Laura: Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going    to make excellent parents. (Chandler and Monica hug each other, and then Joey enters the apartment again.) Joey: LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)   [Scene: The New York City Children's Fund building. Phoebe and    Mike are entering.] Phoebe: (to the Charity guy) We're back! Charity guy: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're    looking for is an ATM. Mike: No, no, we're here to give the money back. Phoebe: Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.  (the Charity guy smiles wanting to take the check, but Phoebe pulls it back    again. His smile fades.)  Phoebe: Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she    gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh! Charity guy: If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe)    congratulations! Mike: (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping    in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this    decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do? Charity guy: You know what? It's not your decision anymore. Mike: What? Charity guy: On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money. Phoebe: But... but... but we're giving you this! Charity guy: Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it    a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe) Phoebe: (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous! Charity guy: Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful    life together. Mike: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come    back in a few years and make an even bigger donation. Charity guy: Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian. Phoebe: Oh, is that you? Charity guy: No!   [Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in    their living room when the phone rings.] Monica: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...    Ok, goodbye. (hangs up) Chandler: Wrong number? Monica: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on    the waiting list. Chandler: That's great! Monica: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's    a baby waiting for us. Oh...  (Chandler and Monica hug and after a while the telephone rings again... Monica's    eyes get bigger. Chandler answers.) Chandler: Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?    COMMERCIAL BREAK  [Scene: The playground. Ross, Rachel and Emma are still there.    Rachel comes walking to Ross and Emma with something between her hands.] Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one. Ross: (nervously) Ok... Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands) Ross: (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok,    get on the swing! Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k... (She slowly grabs the chains of the swing, swings her hair back, and sits down.) Rachel: (more confident) Ok... (She slowly walks forward and backward, to gain speed...) Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH! Ross: See? Rachel: A-alright! I can do this. Ross: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used    to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore. Rachel: That's because he's on your neck. Ross: Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of    the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh... (Ross is now preoccupied with the spider, and forgets that Rachel is still    using the swing. While trying to get rid of the spider, he stands in front of    Rachel, who bumps into him, throwing him on the ground again.) Rachel: ROSS! (Rachel tries to stop mid-swing, and the swing starts to turn from side to    side) end  
Ross: Hey you guys!
Ross: Hey, what are you doing?
Ross: Yeah!
Ross: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact    that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Ross: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Ross: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But    maybe the time after that!
Ross: (he enters) Hi!
Ross: Oh, good!
Ross: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists    out there.
Ross: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under    a bridge!
Ross: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Ross: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and    fire!
Ross: Be-caaauuuse...
Ross: Seriously?
Ross: (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you    in the movie!
Ross: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly    safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and    you'll see!
Ross: Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come    on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you    won’t regret it.
Ross: Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their    irrational fears on their children, do you?
Ross: Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different    species of poisonous swings! 
Monica: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early! Chandler: Ok, ok, here we go. Monica: Ok. Chandler: Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile.

What I really want    is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth) Monica: Yay! Chandler: But you already gave all your money to charity! Phoebe: Well, I’ll just ask for it back! Chandler: I don’t think you can do that! Monica: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some    stupid kids! Chandler: That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.  [Scene: The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they’re    ready to play] Rachel: Ok, careful. Ross: Ok. Rachel: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR! Ross: Rach, she’s got like three hairs! Rachel: I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful!    Oh, my God, I just pulled one out. Ross: I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.  Rachel: Ok. Ross (to Emma): Ready sweety? Rachel: Ok. Ross: Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma) Rachel: Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God,    she does like it! Ross: See, I told you! Rachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil!    Oh, let me push, can I push? Ross: Oh, absolutely! Rachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag. Ross: Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared    of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!     [Scene: The New York City Children's fund ] Mike: We’re seriously asking for our money back? Phoebe: It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,    because one of us gonna have to start flirting. Charity guy: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t    think that that’s ever happened before. Phoebe (to Mike): Gay, go. Mike (to the charity guy): Oh my God, I love your shirt! Phoebe: The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it    back. Charity guy: Excuse me? Phoebe: Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t    want, but it turns out we do. Charity guy: So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children? Mike: Yeah! This feels really good. Phoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me. Charity guy: Hey, it’s not my business, (he takes their check from a    drawer) besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been    spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing… Phoebe: Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important!    And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t    go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an    escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me”    or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty    little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out) Mike: She could have been talking about either one of us.   [Scene: Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door] Laura: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview. Monica: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in. Laura: Thank you! Monica: Would you like something to drink? Laura: Oh, water would be fine. Monica: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited    about getting this process started. Chandler: Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually    to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...    as allowed by law. Laura: Your place is just lovely. Monica: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it. Laura: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples    in the    building adopting? Monica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby    before    them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked) Chandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building. Laura: Oh... Chandler: What? Laura: I just realized why I remember this place. Monica: Really? What is it? Laura: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building    and it    didn't end very well. Monica: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani? Laura: Yes! Chandler: Of course it was! Laura: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he    would call    me and he didn't. Chandler: RAT BASTARD! Laura: So you're not friends with him? Monica and Chandler: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no,    no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No! Laura: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning    on staying at    home with your child... (someone knocks on the door) Joey: (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?       (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it    back in    his face) OW! Laura: What was that? Chandler: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great    with    kids though.   [Scene: Ross and Rachel are at the playground with Emma. Rachel    in putting her back in the stroller and Ross is tending to his wound] Rachel: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay? Ross: SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him)    (To the    kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away) Rachel: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.    That is    the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life. Ross: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault    and kind    of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing.    Nice.  Rachel: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else    gets    hurt? Ross: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,    okay? And    you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.  Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've    always been    jealous of my hair. Ross: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your    silly    fears. Rachel: Alright fine. I'll do it. Ross: Good. Rachel: If you hold a spider.  Ross: (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT?    WHERE? WHERE? Rachel: IF you hold a spider. Ross: I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,       afraid)  [Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler is still leaning    against the door, keeping Joey out, who is still banging and shouting on the    other side.] Joey: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe... Chandler: (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!! Laura: What's going on? Chandler: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey    bangs on    the door again) Joey: Guys!? Monica: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today! Joey: What's going on? Chandler: WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!  (cut to Joey on the other side, who finally leaves the door and goes to his    apartment) Joey: Everything doesn't sound fine! Laura: Is he alright out there by himself? Chandler: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie. Laura: Bert and Ernie! Chandler: (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!  [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike enter] Mike: You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm    sorry about    that. Phoebe: (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.  Mike: Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really    deserve that. Phoebe: Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for    a few    seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from. Mike: No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there. Phoebe: Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted. Mike: Alright, fine. We'll give the money back. Phoebe: And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't    shot    anyone in a really long time.   [Scene: Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing    to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler    and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other. Laura: Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child    in. Monica: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the    furniture,    because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there! Laura: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything    I need    up to here... (She starts checking her form. Chandler sees movement near the window from       the corner of his eye and when he looks he spots Joey climbing up the fire escape    and    onto their balcony. He warns Monica silently.) Monica: (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room? (Joey enters through the side window and jogs towards the kitchen holding a    baseball bat) Chandler: What the hell are you doing? Joey: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble. Chandler: Well, we're not. Joey: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger! Chandler: We don't have a code word. Joey: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word    for danger. (Monica talks loudly in the baby's room) Monica: So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey    behind    the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler) Monica: (To Chandler) What room should we see next? Chandler: Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously) Monica: (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people    don't    get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom). (Joey gets up and look annoyed) Joey: (quivering with anger) I did not care for that! Chandler: (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept    with    our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so    she can't    see you. Joey: Ok, ok! (He leaves) Chandler: Ok! (Joey leaves and closes the door behind him. Chandler walks towards the living    room, but then Joey enters again.) Chandler: What? Joey: I forgot my bat. (He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica and Laura enter the living    room again. When Laura sees Joey, she freezes...) Laura: Oh my God! Chandler: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And    we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat) Laura: What are you doing here? Joey: (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert! Laura: Are you friends with him? Chandler: I can explain... Joey... Joey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back    here. I can't believe you never called me. Laura: Excuse me? Joey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by    the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me. Laura: I gave you my number, you never called me. Joey: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do. Laura: (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave    you my number. Joey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you? Laura: I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry... Joey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the    apartment, leaving her shocked) Laura: Joey, wait! Joey: (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes    the door behind him) Laura: (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed... Chandler: Oh, that's really ok. Monica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard. Laura: Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going    to make excellent parents. (Chandler and Monica hug each other, and then Joey enters the apartment again.) Joey: LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)   [Scene: The New York City Children's Fund building. Phoebe and    Mike are entering.] Phoebe: (to the Charity guy) We're back! Charity guy: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're    looking for is an ATM. Mike: No, no, we're here to give the money back. Phoebe: Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.  (the Charity guy smiles wanting to take the check, but Phoebe pulls it back    again. His smile fades.)  Phoebe: Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she    gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh! Charity guy: If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe)    congratulations! Mike: (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping    in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this    decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do? Charity guy: You know what? It's not your decision anymore. Mike: What? Charity guy: On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money. Phoebe: But... but... but we're giving you this! Charity guy: Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it    a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe) Phoebe: (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous! Charity guy: Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful    life together. Mike: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come    back in a few years and make an even bigger donation. Charity guy: Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian. Phoebe: Oh, is that you? Charity guy: No!   [Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in    their living room when the phone rings.] Monica: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...    Ok, goodbye. (hangs up) Chandler: Wrong number? Monica: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on    the waiting list. Chandler: That's great! Monica: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's    a baby waiting for us. Oh...  (Chandler and Monica hug and after a while the telephone rings again... Monica's    eyes get bigger. Chandler answers.) Chandler: Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?    COMMERCIAL BREAK  [Scene: The playground. Ross, Rachel and Emma are still there.    Rachel comes walking to Ross and Emma with something between her hands.] Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one. Ross: (nervously) Ok... Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands) Ross: (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok,    get on the swing! Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k... (She slowly grabs the chains of the swing, swings her hair back, and sits down.) Rachel: (more confident) Ok... (She slowly walks forward and backward, to gain speed...) Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH! Ross: See? Rachel: A-alright! I can do this. Ross: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used    to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore. Rachel: That's because he's on your neck. Ross: Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of    the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh... (Ross is now preoccupied with the spider, and forgets that Rachel is still    using the swing. While trying to get rid of the spider, he stands in front of    Rachel, who bumps into him, throwing him on the ground again.) Rachel: ROSS! (Rachel tries to stop mid-swing, and the swing starts to turn from side to    side) end  
Ross: Ok.
Ross: Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
Ross: I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this. 
Ross: Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
Ross: See, I told you!
Ross: Oh, absolutely!
Ross: Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared    of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow! 
Ross: SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him)    (To the    kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)
Ross: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault    and kind    of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing.    Nice. 
Ross: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,    okay? And    you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Ross: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your    silly    fears.
Ross: Good.
Ross: (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT?    WHERE? WHERE?
Ross: I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,       afraid) 
Ross: (nervously) Ok...
Ross: (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok,    get on the swing!
Ross: See?
Ross: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used    to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Ross: Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of    the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...

Everyone's sitting on the couch.Monica and Chandler enter]  Chandler:  Hi! Ross: Hey! Monica: Hey! Chandler: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio. Phoebe: Oh, right! Your adoption interview! Monica: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby. Joey: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird! Chandler: And so incorrect! Monica: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us. Ross: Come on, she's gonna love you guys! Chandler: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up. Monica: And a lot could still get in our way. Chandler: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.. Phoebe: What are you gonna name the baby? Chandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word. Joey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys? Monica: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us! Chandler: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'? Monica: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby! Chandler: Yes, but... Monica: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves) Chandler: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!  OPENING CREDITS  [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe's speaking to a girl.] Rachel: (to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with? Joey: I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey! Phoebe: Hey! Joey: So... who's your friend? Phoebe: Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends! Joey: OW, why, why, why? Phoebe: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists! Joey: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with. Phoebe: Mandy. Joey: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs? Phoebe: No. Joey: I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel) Rachel: Do you think I'm someone else? Joey: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach? Rachel: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else! Joey: (pointing at himself) Growth! Phoebe: Fine, I'll give you her number. Joey: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy. Phoebe: SARAH! Joey: Saraaah. Ross: (entering) Hey! Rachel: Hi! Ross: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice. Rachel: Oh! Ross: (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look? Rachel: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away! Ross: C'mon! This looks good! Rachel: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat. Ross: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool! Phoebe: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right? Ross: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.  Joey: I can see why, nice shirt! Ross: You're wearing the same shirt. Joey: Stupid Gap on every corner!  [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering with a man.]  Agency guy: Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica. Monica: Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK? Chandler: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?" Monica: Uh, we're gonna be great. Chandler: You're gonna be great. Monica: Well... obviously! Agency guy: (he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica. Monica: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you. Erica: (whispering) Hi... Chandler: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us. Erica: Hi. Agency guy: I'll let you get acquainted. Chandler: Ok. Erica: So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D. Chandler: That's what our friends call us. Erica: Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating. Monica: I don't know about that. Erica: You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend? Chandler: (astonished) I don't think that's exactly... Monica: (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.   [Scene: Central Perk]  Phoebe: Hey! Joey: Hey. Phoebe: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night. Joey: Well... Phoebe: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back? Joey: Nope. Phoebe: What are you talking about? Sarah's great! Joey: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...  (Sarah picks up some fries from Joey’s plate and Joey looks very angry. Then we’re back to Central Perk and Joey does a you-see-what-I-mean look to Phoebe) Phoebe: That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal! Joey: Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent. Phoebe: What? Joey: ALL FOOD! Phoebe: I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER! Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers! (Rachel enters from the main door) Phoebe: (to Rachel) Oh Rachel: Hi Phoebe: Thank God you’re here. Listen to this! Rachel: what? Phoebe: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries... Rachel: Oh! Oh, no! (Joey looks satisfied) Phoebe: What? You know about the plate thing? Rachel: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ... Phoebe: (to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape? Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma! (Phoebe looks horrified and she turns to watch Joey) Joey: (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD! Phoebe: Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table! Joey: (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about? [Scene: A clothes store. Ross and Phoebe are shopping]  Phoebe: (to Ross) This place is awesome! Ross: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!  (Rachel arrives with a lot of clothes) Rachel: Ah, this place is great! Phoebe: Wow! Ross: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh). Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful! Ross: (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars? Rachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! Ross: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket): Hey, check this out! It’s totally you! Ross: Wow! Phoebe: Yeah! (Ross wears the jackets and look at himself in the mirror) Ross: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys? Phoebe: What? They will be! Ross: All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here. Rachel: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... Ross: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me. Rachel: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. Ross: Really? Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you. Ross: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers? Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?   [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.] Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!” Monica: Amen. Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! Monica: Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands. Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption? Monica: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good. Erica: Wow. Chandler: Yeah, wow. Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock. Erica: (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time. Chandler: No-ot for me it doesn’t. (The agency guy enters the room) Agency guy: So, how’s everything going in here? Erica: We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions. Agency guy: Do you have any question for Erica? Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Agency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it. Chandler: You should be. You’re really on top of stuff.. Agency guy: (to Erica) Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk. Erica: Actually, I don’t think we have to. Monica: We don’t? Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them. Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that? Chandler: Yeah, I did. Monica: (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!  [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel and Phoebe walk in, loaded with bags.]  Rachel: We got some really great stuff! Phoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got. Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?  Phoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination? Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing. Phoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.    [Scene: Ross walks into Central Perk, wearing a pink and white ladies shirt. Joey is on the couch]   Ross: (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.) Joey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! Ross: (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here. Joey: (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that. Ross: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies? Joey: (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!! Ross: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!    [Scene: Monica and Chandler's hotel room. They enter.] Chandler: We are NOT signing those papers. Monica: Why not? Chandler: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else. Monica: God works in mysterious ways. Chandler: You have gotta stop! Monica: But she liked us. Chandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica. Monica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said) Chandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95! Monica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now. Chandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this? Monica: (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. Chandler: I know.. Monica: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us? Chandler: oh, honey.. Monica: (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close. Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.   Monica: (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug) Chandler: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. Monica: (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend? Chandler: You're Jewish. Monica: Technicality!   [Scene: A restaurant. Joey is on his date with Phoebe’s friend, Sarah. They are sitting opposite each other on a table for two. Their waiter approaches with two plates.] Waiter: A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down) Joey: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering! Waiter: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy! Sarah: Mmmh, those fries look delicious. Joey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries) Sarah: (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams? Joey: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams. (Sarah, is grinning and starts to reach over to Joey's plate to take a few clams) Joey: How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his) Sarah: They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again) Joey: (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that? Sarah: Oh, that is so sweet.. Joey: Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back) (Then she reaches over again and Joey moves his plate a little to the left, and she misses, then she reaches out again, and he moves his plate to the right , so she misses again. She tries a third time and this time, Joey pushes his plate so far to the left, it drops off the edge of the table) Joey: (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!! Sarah: What? what is the matter with you? Joey: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? Sarah: But you just said "What's mine is yours"? Joey: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT! Sarah: Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal. Joey: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it).  (Sarah looks a little disgusted)   [Scene: Ross and his date walk into a lobby. They are both wearing their jackets]   Girl: Wow, this place looks great. Ross: Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this. Girl: Me too! (starts to take her coat off) Ross: Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)   [Scene: Back at the restaurant with Joey and Sarah. Joey is holding Sarah's hands] Joey: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you. Sarah: Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams. Joey: (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams. (The waiter arrives with their deserts) Waiter: Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman. Joey: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake. Waiter: Yes, that's Raspberry coule. Joey: (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy. (pushes it aside) Sarah: (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey) Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead. Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece. Sarah: Mmmm! Mmm! (Sarah's beeper starts bleeping) Sarah: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me? Joey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem. (Joey's looking at Sarah's dessert, and takes her plate.) Sarah: What are you doing? I thought you don't share food. Joey: Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule? Sarah: (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street. Joey: (laughing) Really? Sarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table) Joey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room) (Joey sits sideways on his chair, looking at Sarah's chocolate torte, and then looking away from it, nervously playing with his fork, drumming with it on the table every now and then.) Joey: (to the torte) Stop staring at me! (He then straightens himself, and looks at the torte) Joey: Why, just a tiny little... (He takes a little piece of Sarah's dessert. At first he doesn't think it's that special, but then...) Joey: Oh-oh! TIME LAPSE (Sarah enters the room again, and stops when she sees her dessert is missing. Joey has emptied her plate, and has a chocolate covered mouth, just like a kid.) Joey: I'm not even sorry.   [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering.] Erica: Hi! Adoption Agency guy: Hey. Chandler: Hey. Agency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it. Monica: (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture? Erica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler) Monica: Look, doctor! (Chandler takes Monica's hand, and gets serious) Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk...(pause) We're not who you think we are. Agency guy: I don't understand. Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor. Erica: What? Agency guy: That's impossible. Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. Agency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me. Erica: So who are you? Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York. Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram) Erica: So you lied to me before? Monica: Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend. Erica: I can't believe this.  Monica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider... Erica: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this? Monica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file... Erica: I don't want to look at your file! This is over. (She leaves the room, but Chandler runs after her. They meet in the hallway.) Chandler: Erica wait! Erica: I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces) Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. Erica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising. Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again) Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please? (They look at each other. We switch back to Monica. Chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.) Chandler: You still want that baby? (Monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to Chandler, who is twisting with joy. They hug.) Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing! COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene: Central Perk. Joey's on the couch when Ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.] Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman. Joey: (nods) So, why are you still wearing it? Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date? Joey: Ooh... Not so good. Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy? Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse. (they shake hands the way friends would. There's a muffin on the table, and Ross breaks off a piece and wants to put it in his mouth.) Joey: (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD! (Ross puts the piece back on the plate) end     
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Ross: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Ross: (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?
Ross: C'mon! This looks good!
Ross: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Ross: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. 
Ross: You're wearing the same shirt.
 Phoebe: Hey! Joey: Hey. Phoebe: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night. Joey: Well... Phoebe: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back? Joey: Nope. Phoebe: What are you talking about? Sarah's great! Joey: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...  (Sarah picks up some fries from Joey’s plate and Joey looks very angry. Then we’re back to Central Perk and Joey does a you-see-what-I-mean look to Phoebe) Phoebe: That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal! Joey: Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent. Phoebe: What? Joey: ALL FOOD! Phoebe: I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER! Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers! (Rachel enters from the main door) Phoebe: (to Rachel) Oh Rachel: Hi Phoebe: Thank God you’re here. Listen to this! Rachel: what? Phoebe: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries... Rachel: Oh! Oh, no! (Joey looks satisfied) Phoebe: What? You know about the plate thing? Rachel: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ... Phoebe: (to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape? Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma! (Phoebe looks horrified and she turns to watch Joey) Joey: (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD! Phoebe: Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table! Joey: (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about? [Scene: A clothes store. Ross and Phoebe are shopping]  Phoebe: (to Ross) This place is awesome! Ross: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!  (Rachel arrives with a lot of clothes) Rachel: Ah, this place is great! Phoebe: Wow! Ross: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh). Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful! Ross: (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars? Rachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! Ross: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket): Hey, check this out! It’s totally you! Ross: Wow! Phoebe: Yeah! (Ross wears the jackets and look at himself in the mirror) Ross: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys? Phoebe: What? They will be! Ross: All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here. Rachel: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... Ross: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me. Rachel: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. Ross: Really? Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you. Ross: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers? Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?   [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.] Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!” Monica: Amen. Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! Monica: Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands. Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption? Monica: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good. Erica: Wow. Chandler: Yeah, wow. Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock. Erica: (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time. Chandler: No-ot for me it doesn’t.

Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again) Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please? (They look at each other. We switch back to Monica. Chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.) Chandler: You still want that baby? (Monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to Chandler, who is twisting with joy. They hug.) Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing! COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene: Central Perk. Joey's on the couch when Ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.] Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman. Joey: (nods) So, why are you still wearing it? Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date? Joey: Ooh... Not so good. Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy? Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse. (they shake hands the way friends would. There's a muffin on the table, and Ross breaks off a piece and wants to put it in his mouth.) Joey: (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD! (Ross puts the piece back on the plate) end     
 Phoebe: (to Ross) This place is awesome! Ross: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!  (Rachel arrives with a lot of clothes) Rachel: Ah, this place is great! Phoebe: Wow! Ross: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh). Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful! Ross: (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars? Rachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! Ross: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket): Hey, check this out! It’s totally you! Ross: Wow! Phoebe: Yeah! (Ross wears the jackets and look at himself in the mirror) Ross: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys? Phoebe: What? They will be! Ross: All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here. Rachel: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... Ross: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me. Rachel: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. Ross: Really? Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you. Ross: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers? Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?   [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are still talking with Erica.] Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!” Monica: Amen. Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! Monica: Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands. Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption? Monica: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good. Erica: Wow. Chandler: Yeah, wow. Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock. Erica: (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time. Chandler: No-ot for me it doesn’t. (The agency guy enters the room) Agency guy: So, how’s everything going in here? Erica: We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions. Agency guy: Do you have any question for Erica? Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Agency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it. Chandler: You should be. You’re really on top of stuff.. Agency guy: (to Erica) Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk. Erica: Actually, I don’t think we have to. Monica: We don’t? Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them. Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that? Chandler: Yeah, I did. Monica: (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!  [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel and Phoebe walk in, loaded with bags.]  Rachel: We got some really great stuff! Phoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got. Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?  Phoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination? Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing. Phoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.    [Scene: Ross walks into Central Perk, wearing a pink and white ladies shirt. Joey is on the couch]   Ross: (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.) Joey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! Ross: (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here. Joey: (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that. Ross: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies? Joey: (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!! Ross: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!    [Scene: Monica and Chandler's hotel room. They enter.] Chandler: We are NOT signing those papers. Monica: Why not? Chandler: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else. Monica: God works in mysterious ways. Chandler: You have gotta stop! Monica: But she liked us. Chandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica. Monica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said) Chandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95! Monica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now. Chandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this? Monica: (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. Chandler: I know.. Monica: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us? Chandler: oh, honey.. Monica: (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close. Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.   Monica: (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug) Chandler: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. Monica: (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend? Chandler: You're Jewish. Monica: Technicality!   [Scene: A restaurant. Joey is on his date with Phoebe’s friend, Sarah. They are sitting opposite each other on a table for two. Their waiter approaches with two plates.] Waiter: A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down) Joey: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering! Waiter: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy! Sarah: Mmmh, those fries look delicious. Joey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries) Sarah: (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams? Joey: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams. (Sarah, is grinning and starts to reach over to Joey's plate to take a few clams) Joey: How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his) Sarah: They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again) Joey: (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that? Sarah: Oh, that is so sweet.. Joey: Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back) (Then she reaches over again and Joey moves his plate a little to the left, and she misses, then she reaches out again, and he moves his plate to the right , so she misses again. She tries a third time and this time, Joey pushes his plate so far to the left, it drops off the edge of the table) Joey: (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!! Sarah: What? what is the matter with you? Joey: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? Sarah: But you just said "What's mine is yours"? Joey: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT! Sarah: Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal. Joey: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it).  (Sarah looks a little disgusted)   [Scene: Ross and his date walk into a lobby. They are both wearing their jackets]   Girl: Wow, this place looks great. Ross: Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this. Girl: Me too! (starts to take her coat off) Ross: Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)   [Scene: Back at the restaurant with Joey and Sarah. Joey is holding Sarah's hands] Joey: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you. Sarah: Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams. Joey: (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams. (The waiter arrives with their deserts) Waiter: Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman. Joey: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake. Waiter: Yes, that's Raspberry coule. Joey: (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy. (pushes it aside) Sarah: (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey) Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead. Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece. Sarah: Mmmm! Mmm! (Sarah's beeper starts bleeping) Sarah: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me? Joey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem. (Joey's looking at Sarah's dessert, and takes her plate.) Sarah: What are you doing? I thought you don't share food. Joey: Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule? Sarah: (laughing) No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street. Joey: (laughing) Really? Sarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. (puts her plate back at her side of the table) Joey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room) (Joey sits sideways on his chair, looking at Sarah's chocolate torte, and then looking away from it, nervously playing with his fork, drumming with it on the table every now and then.) Joey: (to the torte) Stop staring at me! (He then straightens himself, and looks at the torte) Joey: Why, just a tiny little... (He takes a little piece of Sarah's dessert. At first he doesn't think it's that special, but then...) Joey: Oh-oh! TIME LAPSE (Sarah enters the room again, and stops when she sees her dessert is missing. Joey has emptied her plate, and has a chocolate covered mouth, just like a kid.) Joey: I'm not even sorry.   [Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering.] Erica: Hi! Adoption Agency guy: Hey. Chandler: Hey. Agency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it. Monica: (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture? Erica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler) Monica: Look, doctor! (Chandler takes Monica's hand, and gets serious) Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk...(pause) We're not who you think we are. Agency guy: I don't understand. Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor. Erica: What? Agency guy: That's impossible. Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. Agency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me. Erica: So who are you? Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York. Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram) Erica: So you lied to me before? Monica: Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend. Erica: I can't believe this.  Monica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider... Erica: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this? Monica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file... Erica: I don't want to look at your file! This is over. (She leaves the room, but Chandler runs after her. They meet in the hallway.) Chandler: Erica wait! Erica: I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces) Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. Erica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising. Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again) Chandler: But you did like us.

They meet in the hallway.) Chandler: Erica wait! Erica: I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces) Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. Erica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising. Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again) Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please? (They look at each other. We switch back to Monica. Chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.) Chandler: You still want that baby? (Monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to Chandler, who is twisting with joy. They hug.) Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing! COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene: Central Perk. Joey's on the couch when Ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.] Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman. Joey: (nods) So, why are you still wearing it? Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date? Joey: Ooh... Not so good. Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy? Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse. (they shake hands the way friends would. There's a muffin on the table, and Ross breaks off a piece and wants to put it in his mouth.) Joey: (shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD! (Ross puts the piece back on the plate) end     
Ross: (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
Ross: (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Ross: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Ross: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!
Ross: Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Ross: Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)
Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Teleplay by: Tracy Reilly    Written by: Andrew Reich &amp; Ted Cohen     Produced by: Robert Carlock &amp; Wendy Knoller   Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Sebastiano &amp; Vanessa [Flashback scene from last week, Monica and Chandler's kitchen,    Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler are there.] Jennifer: Previously on Friends... Chandler: How did the job stuff go? Rachel: He offered me one. Ross: (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest. Rachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)  FADE OUT Rachel: Oh, God! Please, somebody  say something. Ross: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris? Chandler: Or facing a bitch of a commute. Rachel: I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away    from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already    talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever    we need to make us feel comfortable. Ross: Okay. Rachel: I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...    Anything we want. Chandler: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica    looks at him and can't really place what he just said) Ross: All right, we'll work it out. Rachel: Thank you! Thank you! Ross: Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want? Rachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe    and Joey enter.) Phoebe: Ooh, what's going on? Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer. Joey: Hey, great! All right! Phoebe: Good for you! Rachel: It's in Paris. Joey: What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,    okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to    Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid    suburbs... Monica: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive... Joey: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it. Rachel: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means    a lot if you could try to get on board. Phoebe: Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.)    Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey... Joey: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA. Rachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so... Joey: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and    Rachel follows him) Rachel: Joey... Phoebe: You okay with this? Chandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but... Phoebe: Talking to Ross. Chandler: I see. Ross: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every    day. How can I be okay with this? Monica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job. Ross: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,    she would take it? Monica: How is that gonna happen? Chandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? Ross: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas    party. We really hit it off. Monica: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron? Ross: I didn't say we were brothers.    OPENING CREDITS  [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe's reading a newspaper. Chandler    and Monica walk in.] Monica: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next    door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna    take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't. Chandler: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse    us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright. Monica: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look? Chandler: What do you think Pheebs? Phoebe: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin    Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? Chandler: Yeah. Phoebe: She died. Chandler: You're kidding! Monica: That's terrible! Phoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across    the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the    wrong one. Chandler: Oh yeah?  Phoebe: Yeah, she was just an agent. Monica: Joey's gonna be *so* upset.  Chandler: I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    Atlantic. Phoebe: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about    everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge. Monica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him? Phoebe: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get    used to everything else. Monica: What if he reads it in the paper? Chandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.  [Scene: Ralph Lauren. Mr Zelner's office. Ross knocks on the    door and enters.] Mr Zelner: May I help you? Ross: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas    party about two years ago. Mr Zelner: Oh right, uhm, Don? Ross: Close. Ron. (shakes hands) Mr Zelner: Uh... What can I do for you? Ross: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back. Mr Zelner: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this? Ross: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll    see if she wants to come back. Mr Zelner: Wow, that is tempting.  Ross: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face    it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that    true? Mr Zelner: She is good! Ross: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there. Mr Zelner: But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah,    it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do. Ross: I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his    way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one    up.) Is this your son?  Mr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What? Ross: Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does    little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?  Mr Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why? Ross: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after    everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.    (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s    not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there    with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils! Mr Zelner: You can really arrange that? Ross: You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.  Mr Zelner: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing    in the world. Ross: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life. Mr Zelner: That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always    reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs. Ross: He’ll be fine.  [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe’s reading, Joey has just entered    the room] Joey: Hey Phoebe. Phoebe: Hey. Everything ok? Joey: I’m just mad at my agent. Phoebe: Estelle? Why? Joey: There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason. Phoebe: I’m guessing she does.  Joey: Well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I’m wanna hear it,    because she keeps doing this. Phoebe: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her. Joey: Ok. Why? Phoebe: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.    (she leaves) Joey: I love that saying! (Phoebe is outside, taking her cell phone out of her bag and making a call.    Joey is inside, and his mobile phone starts ringing). Joey: Hello? Phoebe (doing Estelle): Joey, it’s Estelle. Joey: I was just gonna call you! That’s weird. Phoebe-Estelle: It’s a little coincidental, but believable.    (Joey nods in agreement). Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why    I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie. Joey: Yeah, actually I am! Phoebe-Estelle: I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!   Joey: That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball. Phoebe-Estelle: Don’t take that tone with me. Who you    think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic? Joey: No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok?    And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it. Phoebe-Estelle: What are you saying? Joey: I’m saying that… (pause). This isn't  working for me    anymore, ok? Estelle, you’re fired. Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone). Phoebe: Man, tough week for Estelle!   [Scene: Joey’s apartment. Rachel’s there and Ross    enters the room with a stuffed dinosaur] Ross: Hi. Rachel: Hi. Ross: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep    without it. Rachel: Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her. Ross: Ok. Rachel: Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph    Lauren called, and gave me my job back! Ross: Nooo! Rachel: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out    of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling    apart without me. Ross: So, you’re not going to Paris. Rachel: No, I’m still going. Ross: Wh… wh…what? Rachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,    the offered me more money! Isn’t that great? Ross: Yeeeah! (They high-five)    [Scene: house next to the one the Bings are moving into. Chandler    and Monica knock, a lady opens the door.] Monica: Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we  could just take a look around. Lady: Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now,    but please, look around. Monica: Thanks. Chandler: It feels like we’re cheating on our house.    And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house,    that does stuff that our house won’t do? Monica: Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks    like a cave! What a hole! Lady: So? What do you think? Monica: Love it! Lady: Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady    upstairs is goning to make another one. Monica: They could be our neighbors, what are they like? Lady: Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids,    he's on Wall Street and she… Janice: Oh my God! (Chandler and Monica are speechless). Chandler (to Monica): Sure.  [Scene: Joey’s apartment. He’s there and Phoebe comes    in.] Phoebe: Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok? Joey: Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be    killing her. Phoebe: No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might. Joey: I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like    her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing    he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again. Phoebe: No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call    you (Joey considers it) Joey: Why? Phoebe: Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ...    is the key... to a happy heart. Joey: (impressed) You blow me away.  Phoebe: (picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her    to call you? Joey: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. (Phoebe stops    herself from laughing and leaves)   [Scene: The house Monica and Chandler are viewing. Janice comes    down the stairs.] Janice: What a small world! Chandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce! Realtor: You two know each other? Janice: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man    out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating    laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna    have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler,    who tries to get away from her) Chandler: (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted) Monica: No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps) Chandler: (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!? Monica: (looks confused and scared) I don't know    why. Janice: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence.    But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to    get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk    numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)  Chandler: This can not be happening! Monica: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.    Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will. Chandler: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the Hitlers. Monica: (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands)    All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house    into a guest house. Chandler: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money!? Monica: Okay, you come up with an idea. Chandler: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house. We can still get out. Monica: But we love our house. Chandler: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder    out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) "Oh My God"!   Monica: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever    we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise.    I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls    jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking    it pushing something up) Chandler: (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we    have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly    outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)   [Scene: Mr. Zellner's office. There is a knock on the door.] r Zelner: Who is it? Ross: (enters) It's me. Ron. (Mr. Zellner looks annoyed)    Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might    be able to get her to come back.  Mr Zelner: This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees,    is not my main job. Ross: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks    hopeful) Mr Zelner: (obviously amused) Not good, Ron.  Ross: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this (Takes    a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica. Mr Zelner: (Takes a long look at the egg while he considers it) Wow, that's    pretty cool (Takes the egg from Ross) Ross: Huh? So? We have a deal? Mr Zelner: Okay, you got it. Ross: Yes! yes!  Mr Zelner: This is gonna make me very popular. Ross: Oh, (grins) Believe me, the ladies, they love it! Mr Zelner: (looks at Ross, for a long moment, confused) I meant with my son. Ross: Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs    up and leaves)   [Scene: Joey's apartment. He walks in reading his mail, and plays    back his messages on the answering machine] Answering machine: Joey, this is Al T. Booker, (Looks annoyed  that he called him) the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle  passed away. (Looks shocked) I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her  at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.  Joey: Oh my God. (Still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) Hello? Phoebe: (on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey,    it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid) Joey: Estelle? Phoebe: Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for    firing me. Joey: (still scared) Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me? Phoebe: Well, I didn't think I should just drop by... Joey: No, no, no! (Starts looking around the room, terrified) Don't drop by,    don't drop by! Phoebe: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay. Joey: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there? Phoebe: (Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with    the career. You're gonna be huge. Joey: Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. (Hangs up and reads the phone display)    "out of area". Boy, I'll say.   [Scene: The house next door to Chandler and Monica's new house.    Chandler is pacing worriedly through the living room when Janice enters.] Janice: Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on  the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it. Chandler: The Hitlers will be so disappointed. Janice: All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see    you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh) Chandler: Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to    be here. Janice: Oh, me too... (laughs) Chandler: Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off. Janice: Huh? Chandler: I never stopped loving you. Janice: Oh... my... Chandler: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice    Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein. Janice: Chandler, what are you talking about? Chandler: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and    Monica never have to know a thing. Janice: I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this...    heat between us. Chandler: (stunned) Obviously. Janice: But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't    think we should get this house now. Chandler: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away. Janice: Chandler, one of us has got to be strong. Chandler: I understand. Janice: Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses    Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks    at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves) Chandler: (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.   [Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is working on his laptop when    Rachel enters with Emma.] Rachel: Hi! Ross: Hey! Rachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today. Ross: What? Rachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered    me more money. Ross: They did? Rachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll    do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I    don't even know what department that guy's in. Ross: So, what are you gonna do? Rachel: Well, I took it. Ross: That's great! So you're staying in New York! Both: YAY! WHOO! YAY! Ross: You're excited, right? Rachel: (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great.    It's certainly the easier choice... Ross: Right! Rachel: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to    Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital    of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's    fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of    that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this    follows her example) Ross: Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.    Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared. Rachel: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when    I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared...    But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around) Ross: (after a long pause) You should go. Rachel: What? Ross: It's what you want. You should go. Rachel: You really think so? Ross: I really do. Rachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back... Ross: (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in    the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll    understand. Rachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris. Ross: Yeah... Rachel: Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross! Ross: Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug) Rachel: Oh! Oh, I'm so happy. Ross: Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out) COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene: Estelle's memorial service. Joey is giving a speech.    Next to him is a blown op photograph of Estelle behind her desk and there's    a man standing next to him.] Joey: Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects    to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (Joey looks at the photograph)    ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (Joey    looks for his notes. The man next to him is chewing something.) Dude, where's    my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at Joey.) That is    entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. (he applauds and Al shows that there's    nothing left in his mouth.) THE END   
Ross: (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Ross: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: All right, we'll work it out.
Ross: Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?
Ross: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every    day. How can I be okay with this?
Ross: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,    she would take it?
Ross: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas    party. We really hit it off.
Ross: I didn't say we were brothers.
Ross: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas    party about two years ago.
Ross: Close. Ron. (shakes hands)
Ross: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Ross: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll    see if she wants to come back.
Ross: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face    it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that    true?
Ross: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.
Ross: I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his    way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one    up.) Is this your son?

Ross: So, what are you gonna do?
Ross: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Ross: You're excited, right?
Ross: Right!
Ross: Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.    Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Ross: (after a long pause) You should go.
Ross: It's what you want. You should go.
Ross: I really do.
Ross: (picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in    the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to Zelner) I'm sure he'll    understand.
Ross: Yeah...
Ross: Yeah, yeah, oh! (They hug)
Ross: Then I'm happy too. (They're still hugging - fade out)
